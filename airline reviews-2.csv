We bought two return flights (Ljubljana-Prague-Ljubljana, Ljubljana-Warsaw-Ljubljana), and several days before departure both direct flights from and to Prague were canceled and a flight to Warsaw was merged with Prague flight (so added necessary stopover). Instead of a direct flight to Prague Adria Airways finally offered a transfer via Munich. When we arrived at the airport (21/6/2018), we found that the flight to Munich had more than an hour of delay, and therefore it was not possible to catch the next flight from Munich to Prague. The flight to Munich was full of people from the original canceled flight to Prague, who subsequently wanted to continue to Prague. Although the Adria Airways staff were present at the airport, no one came to inform the passengers and the result was tremendous confusion and lack of information. Ljubljana airport servicing staff finally informed us that Adria Airways staff refused to come! Also wasn't possible to call the Adria Airways hotline. Maybe it had been overloaded due to the number of disgruntled passengers because the next gate was full of people waiting for a delayed flight to Vienna, where there also wasn't anybody from Adria Airways who could provide any information. Unfortunately this flight left without us and we were all forced to ride from the Munich airport to a more than 30 km distant hotel and the next morning at 6am again back.

Overall, the flight services of Adria are those of an average, reliable, small European carrier. I have flown them many times over the years, and I have seldom experienced any problems with the flights themselves. Returning to Vienna from a visit to Albania and Slovenia in September, however, I had an encounter with Adria that has revealed just how much their customer service quality could be improved. Adria offers opportunities to purchase business class upgrades or empty economy class seats through Optiontown. Business class upgrades on Adria are a joke because you're paying at least 50EUR for an empty seat next to you and a snack. The option to purchase an empty economy class seat at 19EUR is a great deal though, in my opinion. Having selected this option for my LJU-VIE flight, I received a confirmation that my transaction had cleared and the extra seat had been assigned next to me. Fast forward to the actual flight: there had been an aircraft change from the CRJ-900 to an ATR-72 (Darwin Airlines/Etihad Regional), but I still had my empty seat. The ATR-72 has two seats that face towards the rear of the plane at the front of the cabin, and one of the women seated there was scared to fly backwards, so the flight attendant unilaterally reassigned her to my empty seat without asking. It's a short flight, and I didn't want to cause a scene, so I just let it all happen assuming I could easily get a refund for my 20EUR transaction. It took exactly one month for Adria's customer service team to respond to me, and they said that my ""business class upgrade"" had not cleared, so I was not charged. I had never requested a business class upgrade, and I was charged for the empty seat I had in fact requested, so I sent all of the relevant receipts and statements back to Adria. Three weeks later, I still have yet to receive a response, so I simply disputed the charge with my credit card company that was easily able to understand the issue and refunded the money. 3-4 weeks+ response time from customer service is absolutely embarrassing, and Adria should be ashamed of their operations. It's sad for an otherwise perfectly acceptable airline to lose a customer over 20EUR.",Adria Airways,ATR-72,,

I have spent a lifetime of flying and the Adria product, I am sorry to say, is grossly inadequate. There is nothing appealing about Adria's offering and what incentive do they have to lift their standard when there is no competition to stimulate improvement? The entire fleet is tired and outdated. The business class product is non existent, staff are at best disinterested, leaning towards unfriendly. And what's with those announcements? They are completely impossible to understand, not just in English and German but also in Slovenian. If not having flown as often as I have to know what the announcements are about, there is no hope in hell that a normal person can understand the dribble that comes over the PA. Guess how many uninformed passengers does that make for? If one is not fluent in a language, and heavily accented, then one must slow down so others can hopefully understand you. But what's their excuse of not pronouncing Slovenian correctly. Everything is executed at such a speed so they can place a tick against that task, yet no care is invested to make sure the task is executed effectively. ! Pick up your game or your end will come one day when monopoly is broken (look around the world to learn from other such stories).

Although we were informed about possibility to connect to on-board wi-fi, I couldn't manage to do that. If you do not expect a 5-star service, Adria should be a good option for quick and not too expensive flight.",Adria Airways,CRJ700,2,

When I pointed out that they were able to sell duty free with visa cards she huffed and puffed and basically said it would be ""difficult"". She never offered me a tiny cup of water.

In one direction followed signs into a passage which was locked. A couple of minutes later somebody came and let us out to go through security.

68,,Economy Class,,,no,,,,,1,5,Adria Airways customer review,J Harvey (United Kingdom) 7th January 2011,unk,I fly Adria a lot (at least once a month) and find them ok. The service is mixed. Often the supervisor is not ready for boarding and there is no-one to greet. Last time when I boarded the crew were having their photo taken on the tarmac so we all had to stand and wait until they finished. Food is fine and the hand luggage service where it is delivered on the tarmac on landing works well on the CRJ aircraft.,Adria Airways,,,
69,,Economy Class,,,no,,,,,1,5,Adria Airways customer review,Axel Bosch (Spain) 10th October 2010,unk,I fly Adria quite a lot (aprox 2 flts a month). My routes are normally VIE-LJU or ZRH-LJU. I always wondered why Adria is not high profile airline being small can be a plus. The CRJ200 and 1000 are OK specially 1000 which are brand new and also A319 latest delivery. I hate that they never board on time neither depart on time. For 20 pax you should be in the air in about 15 min. But they lose a lot of time after the boarding is completed and the take off. The service is worse every time. Now you get a small pack of seeds or dry fruit and a bottle of water. The flights are normally only 30 mins but nevertheless I miss the nice box with good sandwich water and a small dessert. The price is well overpriced for what they offer. There were old inflight magazines in cabin. Crew is good but sometimes too familiar with passengers or fellow colleagues.,Adria Airways,,,

The airline is 3 star but my ticket had 5 star price tag. Online sale worked fine online check-in system issued me a pass with wrong boarding time (nearly 2 hours early). Luckily their call center worked well and I was told to report to the airport at normal time and use ""wrong"" boarding pass. It really worked. There were about 14 passengers onboard Canadair200. The plane was new and clean. Seats were very narrow however seat pitch was okay. My seat didn't work well so I did take off and landed in reclined position. Food was much below average (small cheese sandwich) bar service was good and generous. Flight departed late but made it in the air and landed about ontime. Crew were cheerful and attentive. My special meal was delivered and was okay (much better then standard sandwiches offered to other passengers). All in all a real strong 3 star experience but overpriced ticket. Also saw no difference between business and economy cabin. Same seats for different price.",Adria Airways,,,

72,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,5,Adria Airways customer review,A Ivanovski (Macedonia) 26th May 2009,unk,It is reliable and with good connections between Balkans and Western Europe. However I always find the service on the leg between Skopje and Ljubljana to be lower quality than the leg Ljubljana- Amsterdam Ljubljana - Frankfurt etc. The crew is not so friendly and helpful they always offer tuna sandwiches (assuming that because of the Muslim travelers). I insisted on a ham sandwich and never got it. Twice on the leg Ljubljana-Skopje (or vice versa). If Adria pretends to be a quality part of Star Alliance it shouldn't distinguish among the passengers which fly Skopje - Ljubljana and those flying from Ljubljana to Western Europe.,Adria Airways,,,
73,,,,,no,,,,,,3,Adria Airways customer review,M Jerman 28th February 2009,unk,LGW-LJU in Y class. Adria Airways now offer check in on line so it was straight to security which was great. Boarding quick and efficient. Plane downgraded from CRJ9 to CRJ2 but emergency exit seat reservation honoured. Waited on the stand for 30 minutes with no communication from the flight deck. Service was nice with sandwiches hot and cold drinks. Cabin crew were quite robotic seems that pursers are trained not to smile under any circumstances. If crew would have been bit more cheerful and communication from the flight deck bit better it would have been 4*.,Adria Airways,,,

75,,,,,no,,,,,,4,Adria Airways customer review,Philip Loveder 12th May 2008,unk,Ljublijana-Amsterdam. A great little airline. Although the CRJ-200 is a little cramped the service was good with a proper meal adequate refreshments and competent cabin crew. Their inflight magazine is in English and Slovenian and has an interesting mix of articles and company information. Same can't be said about Brnk international airport however! This airport needs a 'spruce up' to say the least.,Adria Airways,,,
76,,,,,no,,,,,,4,Adria Airways customer review,Nick Fortuna 11th February 2008,unk,FRA-VIE-FRA on CRJ200. Cheapest option when compared to Lufthansa and Austrian plying this short 1.5 hour flight. Small plane meant a long bus ride to remote stand position. Larger carry-on bags had to be deposited in a trolley parked next to the plane. Aircraft spotless but leather seats showing their age - quite saggy in the squab. Service consisted of a choice of crusty cheese or ham roll followed by drinks tea & coffee. FAs smiling. The return was similarly uneventful but again a long bus ride at FRA. Luggage claim was quick.,Adria Airways,,,
77,,,,,no,,,,,,unk,Adria Airways customer review,Simon Summers 4th October 2007,unk,BRU-LJU-BRU. Outward flight on a CRJ200 very nice - comfortable excellent service and a good breakfast. Return flight on a 737 leased from Ukrainian airlines was also reasonable despite the limited legroom. Earning Star Alliance points also a plus - would recommend.,Adria Airways,,,
78,,,,,no,,,,,,unk,Adria Airways customer review,Daniel Castaldi 8th August 2007,unk,I often fly with Adria (50 flights per year). Since Adria is member of Star Alliance there are pretty good connections to the most destinations in Europe. The onboard service is good staff quiet nice. Home base airport in Ljubljana has been upgraded and is getting more international. The business lounge is not on the level it should be - old furniture bad food choice dark. The 3 stars that have been given to Adria are correct.,Adria Airways,,,
79,,,,,no,,,,,,unk,Adria Airways customer review,Tom Maule 14th July 2007,unk,LGW-LJU-LGW on an older but clean A320. Outwards in 7A with plenty of legroom return in 12F with adequate legroom but need to be careful as the plastic shell on the bottom of the seat in front had started to crack with some sharp edges. Cheese roll served outbound and a jam filled croissant on the return - better than nothing but room for improvement. Coffee and soft drinks free but only one round early in the flight. Very pleasant crew on both sectors. Only gripe was baggage collection at LJU - three flights on one carousel and they seemed to unload baggage in batches from each flight turn about which caused chaos. The second carousel sat unused for the first 40 minutes waiting!,Adria Airways,,,
80,,,,,no,,,,,,unk,Adria Airways customer review,Jens Reinke 24th March 2007,unk,Frankfurt-Ljubljana-Munich in business class: the first flight was on a B737 in the colours of Ukraine International and that plane's interior was substandard while the second flight was on a new CRJ. Both flights on time and without glitch. The service is friendly but meals should be improved. Overall they gave the impression of being a pleasant short haul airline.,Adria Airways,,,
81,,,,,no,,,,,,unk,Adria Airways customer review,Xuess Wee 9th October 2006,unk,Zurich-Ljubljana return. About 2 hours+ journey. Both sector uses the Bombardier Regional Jet CRJ200. Small plane but the 2-3 crews on both sectors were friendly and the service efficient. Seats were comfortable and the planes in good clean conditions. Light meals were served - generally a roll here or a pie there plus drinks. The inflight magazine is surprisingly rich with information on Slovenian culture and way of life and is one of the best I have read. You board the planes on the tarmac via buses from the gates though and not through connecting bridges.,Adria Airways,,,
82,,,,,no,,,,,,unk,Adria Airways customer review,Jacob Ellefsen 29th September 2006,unk,LGW-LJU return. Outbound was on A320 seated towards the front of Y-class on a very empty flight. The crew were friendly enough and served a ham or cheese roll and round of drinks. LJU airport was easy to use and out within minutes. The coach ride into town goes through some nice Slovenian countryside. Return was on a B737-500 flight was full and had a middle seat but exit row (9E) seat pitch was great. Again right after take off was served with a cream pie desert and drinks. Crew were again friendly and another smooth flight that landed about 15mins ahead of schedule.,Adria Airways,,,
83,,,,,no,,,,,,unk,Adria Airways customer review,Philip Jowett 27th September 2006,unk,LGW-LJU-LGW last week overall impressed with standard of service on A320. The food in economy was very basic but I didn't expect any! Drinks free. Was allocated row 11 (emergency exit) with out asking she said your very tall(6'4) I will give you some more leg room! Only minor complaint was the seat base comfort it was rock hard like sitting on a wood bench. On the return the seat in row 25 was little better they seem to have cut back on the foam. Crew were excellent a nice airline all in all.,Adria Airways,,,
84,,,,,no,,,,,,unk,Adria Airways customer review,Aisleyne Moxanne 2nd August 2006,unk,DUB-NAP. Was expecting very poor standards of both safety and comfort from this airline but was surprised. Flight at 5.00 am and the FA's were refreshed and alert. Pre flight safety procedures were clear and as high a standard as any other 3 star airline. The seats were quite hard and leg room was limited but the flight was made pleasant by friendly FA's. In flight catering was poor considering it was a four hour flight. We were handed almost frozen sandwiches and a juice box. Baggage collection was mayhem. All in all the flight was fair and would fly Adria again - but the airline does not compare to other 3 star airlines such as Aer Lingus and KLM.,Adria Airways,,,
85,,,,,no,,,,,,unk,Adria Airways customer review,Alexander Lindley 21st February 2006,unk,Frankfurt to Vienna and was quite satisfied. I was surprised when the flight attendant started giving out meals as I did not expect to be fed at all on such a short flight of only 55 minutes. It was perhaps a bit cramped on board the Canadair Regional Jet though I wouldn't complain about it. Crew was overall quite friendly and efficient.,Adria Airways,,,
86,,,,,no,,,,,,unk,Adria Airways customer review,G Evans 1st October 2005,unk,Flew to Ljubljana from Gatwick. Plane was a new Canadair Regional Jet small (40 seats) but good leg room and comfortable. Both cabin crew were friendly. Food was just a cheese or ham roll but fine for a 1 hr 40 minute flight. And Adria were one of the only airlines leaving Gatwick that evening not to be delayed. Return flight was an A320 full comfortable and good service once again. Would recommend Adria again and worth paying the extra 20quid over Easyjet for flying from Gatwick and not having to pay for food or drink.,Adria Airways,,,
87,,,,,no,,,,,,unk,Adria Airways customer review,David Grey 15th September 2005,unk,Round trip LGW - LJU in Economy Class both legs on an A320. Service pretty friendly planes clean & well-maintained flights on time. Food on each leg (outbound mid-morning return early morning) was a simple processed cheese roll though for a two-hour flight the food is probably not the most important aspect of the journey.

89,,,,,no,,,,,,unk,Adria Airways customer review,Alex Stare 18th March 2004,unk,Flew march 12/14 on JP from ZRH-LJU-ZRH. The flights were on time the flight attendants nice and helpful. The sandwich has got an upgrade and is now equal to LH. A Minus point was that they were handing out only Apple Juices - if you wanted to have wine or other drinks you had to ask specifically for it. This gives me kind of a cheap impression as it seems to the passenger that they wanted to hide it from them. The wine they served was below industry standards and not what a wine country like Slovenia should serve its guests on their trip to the country. I absolutely agree that on such short legs there is no necessity of any food/drinks however either this is clearly defined in the service guide of the airline or then crews should adhere to their service guidelines.,Adria Airways,,,

All flights departed and arrived on time and the onboard service was efficient and reasonably friendly. Hot meals were served on all flights although the quality of these varied from disgusting to just OK. All drinks were complimentary. The aircraft (A320 and CRJ) were modern and spotlessly clean. Business Class seating is identical to economy with a moveable curtain. Transiting at Ljubljana was painless although it is a very small airport and the Business Class lounge is nothing special. I would happily fly with them again although they do need to improve the quality of their meals.,Adria Airways,,,
92,,,,,no,,,,,,unk,Adria Airways customer review,G Chew 6th December 2002,unk,I have just returned from a long weekend in Ljubljana flying on Adria from London Gatwick. The outbound flight was ok (food portions were a bit stingy given the 2 hour 20 minute flight time) and we arrived early into Ljubljana. Beware about arriving on a Saturday - the coach to the city centre are few and far between. I ended up taking a taxi which cost me 6500 SIT (about UKP 20) whereas the bus was 600 SIT (1.40). On the return flight Adria cancelled the flight for 'technical reasons'. Judging by the low number of people that went to the passenger service counter I think the reason for cancellation may have been more economic than technical. I was rerouted via Munich which added over an hour and a half to the journey and we flew into Heathrow (with BA) instead of Gatwick which left me with a useless train ticket and no way of getting home. The flight to Munich with Adria was good and an edible snack was served with apple juice. Despite the problems with the return journey Adria seems to be a reasonable airline and is an ok (if not the only) choice to get to this country.,Adria Airways,,,
93,,,,,no,,,,,,unk,Adria Airways customer review,Francisco Camino 25th August 2002,unk,I have flown Adria recently on a LH code share from Munich to Ljubjana and return. In both cases the plane was a brand new CRJ. Both flights were really smooth and the crews really efficient and helpful. Pilots kept us informed about everything during both flights. It was sunset and dusk and the flight over the alps was absolutely scenic. Despite the narrow cabin of the CRJ the pitch is quite generous and the leather seats comfortable. Both flights lasted 45 minutes and from MUC to LJU I travelled tourist class. Normally in short flights there isnt time for much than a drink. We receive an apple juice a cheese and salad sandwich plus coffee and tea. The LJU-MUC and due to an overbooking was on business. We were offered an orange juice prior to departure and then a tasty breakfast consisting in bacon and scramble eggs fruit salad a croissant and coffe and tea. Superb for such a short segment. Not being a prime choice its an airline which is pleasant to flight.,Adria Airways,,,

Had 3 issues: 1. They overbooked our flight and bumped many people. We bought our flight 3 months ahead, but checked in about 18 hours before our flight (they allow check-in up to 24 hours ahead). We were issued a “standby” ticket without any seats. When we got to the gate, we were told we may or may not get onto the flight and if we didn’t then we would have to wait 4 hours for the late night flight, or try again in the morning. Lots of other people in the same situation. We were never issued boarding passes but we kept following up with the person at the ticket counter until they gave us passes, it seems like due to our persistence and nothing systematic. Luckily we got on that flight, but others didn’t. Nowhere in the policy does it say that whether or not you get on the flight is related to your check-in time. If you take Aegean, check in right away and be persistent about asking for seats! 2. They apply a checked bag policy at will. We were sitting near the gate. The gate attendants approached us and asked to weigh our bags. Our bags, which fit easily into any overhead bin (including previous Aegean flights) were found to be slightly overweight (apparently 9kgs are allowed, ours were about 10kgs). We asked if we could move 1kg into our purse / backpack. They said no, they need to check the two bags, and by the way they are charging us 40Euro per bag. This was for a 45 min flight from an island to Athens. We had no choice and were forced to pay. Also, there was no consistency in the way this rule was applied. We saw plenty of other people with carry-ons larger than ours allowed on the plane and there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. 3. Every flight we were on was late. Two of three were late by over 45 mins. We didn’t have any connections, but I imagine many connecting flights were missed. And, this didn’t happen to us, but it’s worth noting that when we landed in Athens, there were about 30 people waiting at the lost baggage desk. Most of them looked very angry. I asked one person what happened, and apparently an entire flight did not have their bags transferred at a connection. So not only will they force you to check your carry-on and then pay for a checked bag, they might lose it too. All-in-all, this is a pretty bad track record for 3 short island hop flights.",Aegean Airlines,,,

As we were leaving the plane in Larnaca I commented to the cabin staff at the exit of the plane that Aegean Airlines was now my new favorite airline. And it is. I opted to give the airline a rating of 9 instead of 10 due to two items: both flights were short.

I can understand that delays pile up along the day but, knowing that this happens, they should review their schedules. Or try to catch up during the flight. The excuse is most times the same, the ridiculous ""late arrival of the aircraft"" (thank you!). Their app is also faulty lately (you call then, show them, and still don't accept it, things like not being able to check in, wrong pricing information, no incoming messages with flight delays, etc. Also, when they change planes and they cannot relocate you in a pay seat, you have to call them to get a refund! What they don't miss is to send a a silly survey upon landing asking about the quality of the service on board (""forcing"" you to chose an area of improvement!), while not asking for the end-to-end experience (from reservation, check in, baggage drop, boarding, disembarkation, luggage). They deserve some competition, they've simply got worse in service, unfortunately for those of us hooked to them.",Aegean Airlines,A321 Neo,3,

If anyone of you has ever called Aegean for similar matters, you'll know that 9 out of 10 times, it's always the ""system"". It's evident that they're manipulating the availability of their seat maps to force you to pay extra fees even when you've purchased their highest economy class fare.  We paid the 9 Euro fee this time but from our main choice, they will become our last choice until they get their act together. And of course it came as no surprise to read so many other reviews here from other passengers complaining about similar situations. I'm attaching a picture of the two seat maps and I leave you to draw your own conclusions. The bookable seats are those in blue and in my seatmap, window and aisle seats are not available.",Aegean Airlines,A320,,2

Aegean Airlines started off as a promising, refreshing presence in the Greek market but it is clear that they are in a steep decline. We've experienced such poor customer service in the last several years on a number of occasions. Refunds that took 18 months and countless calls and e-mails to process (for flights that Aegean Airlines canceled). Missed connections due to flight delays where they failed to assist us to reach our destination or arrange overnight accommodation for us. We were asked to cover the expenses on our own and then submit the receipts to receive compensation. We've taken trips where we were asked to pay service fees to change Comfort Flex and Business Class tickets. These two categories are their most unrestrictive fares and allow same day changes without a penalty, yet on a number of occasions, when their website failed to successfully change our tickets, we were asked to pay a service fee to proceed with the change. I could go on and on with a number of other disappointing practices but all in all, it seems that they've adopted policies and restrictions that we only find present with the so called low-cost carriers. All while charging full service carrier regular fares. Until they re-adjust their policies to a more customer service oriented level, we will certainly avoid flying with them in the future.

Two weeks after I booked the ticket Aegean changed the departure time for the Athens-Thessaloniki flight to 10am. I accepted the reschedule taking into account the accumulated tiredness from the overnight flight. A week before the departure Aegean decided to flight schedule from midnight to 20.30 arriving in Athens at 02.30 in morning, resulting overall on an 8 hours transit overnight at Athens airport. I found this inconsiderate and disrespectful to their customer. Apparently this is the way Aegean has been operating all their flights from Manchester since the beginning of June 2021 however they do not correct the flight times so to be aware prior to booking what is the accurate travel schedule.

One day before, I had to change the dates and they said that I had to pay 35 euros fee for reissuing the ticket because the price of the fare was slightly different (in fact the fare of the new date was lower) and they offered me to pay the difference of the price of the next more expensive fare. I could rebook free of charge only if the fare was the same (according to the terms and conditions)! I can understand that it is a difficult time for airlines but they have to be fair also with their customers. I almost always book economy and not refundable prices, so I am not familiar with the conditions of the flexible price in general, but I find it a very sneaky way to attract customers and reservations! How likely is it to find an exactly similar fare? Very small! So I don't see the point in calling it a flexible ticket!

I'll have to start with the fact that they let you have a checked in bag which weighs up to a certain amount of kilos for free, which as far as I'm concerned is not the case for many airlines. Flight was initially delayed by half an hour or so which for me wasn't a lot as I didn't have any connecting flights to worry about, but I understand that for some people this might not be the case. Boarding was done via jetbridge and was rather fast considering the flight was full. We boarded the plane, but didn't take off for nearly another two hours due to a thunderstorm over the airport. The seats were very comfortable for Economy class, but again I'm only 1.62 so my opinion on this probably isn't relevant. The pilots made an announcement straight away and the flight attendants handed out free drinks to everyone during the time we spent on the ground. The pilots kept informing us of the situation and when we finally took off the flight was extremely turbulent, but they handled the situation pretty well I must say. A free hot meal was provided for all passengers, both Bussiness and Economy class which is very rare these days for an intra-european flight. When we arrived in Athens the pilots made an apology for the delay and announced that every passenger who had missed their connecting flight would be offered either a free rebooking or a voucher but I can't remember exactly, as I didn't need one. Luggage came out quickly and it wasn't damaged in any way. The price was ok but considering their excellent service I can't even think about complaining about the price. The only thing that I didn't quite like was the fact that there was no in flight entertaining as there were no screens which having flown on their A320s as well I know are present there, but not in the A321, but again, I'm not complaining.

It might be my impression but it feels like the legroom has been reduced, seats are awful and  uncomfortable. The customer service is  average along with the cleanliness of the aircraft. As long as the flight is fully booked the land crew requests from clients to board with just the hand luggage and deliver the carry-on luggage to the hold (free of charge as they claim). This review was written with the value-for-money in mind as the primary factor. Hence there is no reason at all booking the tickets with Aegean if you are about to pay more and receive the same legroom and seat-comfort to any other low-cost flying company Since Aegean allows its passengers to fly in Economy/Go-Light with the standard carry-on luggage and handbag allowance (as stated on their ticket), they should adhere to that. The reason passengers do that is because it allows them to quickly grab their bags and catch the next flight without having to wait on the belt to retrieve luggage. I agree with the company's policy to weigh/measure the carry-on luggage prior to boarding in order to filter any passengers carrying excessive carry-ons. However as long as the passenger is compliant  they shouldn't force him/her deliver their carry-on to the hold. I am a Silver member over the past 3 years and during this flight I requested for my ticket to be upgraded. However the representative assured me that I wasn't able since the flight was in cooperation with Lufthansa.

We dealt with United for four days trying to get our luggage from Newark to Athens. Eventually they told us to Taxi back to the airport and promised our luggage was there, a very kind supervisor came out and talked to us to explain the luggage was not, in fact, there. (We did not even ask for a supervisor.) He was very understanding and patient and asked us to trust him. At this point our time in Athens was over and we left the airport to board our cruise ship, thinking there was no way we'd ever get our luggage in the middle of the ocean. The next night there it was in our cabin when we opened the door! We couldn't believe it. The supervisor had gotten our luggage from Newark to Athens, then onto Santorini Island, where our Princess Cruise ship then transported it from the island and onto the ship and then to our room - all within a day. In all we went five days without luggage, but once Aegean was involved we had it within about a day, in a much more difficult route than it would have been for United to simply put it on the plane to Athens. Everyone was so compassionate and kind. But it didn't end there. Upon arriving home, I began the impossible task of dealing with United to receive compensation - they had told us to keep all receipts for the five days without luggage and we had. We spent hours on hold, hours on the phone, getting nowhere. Finally, based on the File Reference number (that I'd given them over and over and over) someone finally clued in and explained the International agreement that wherever you end up is who is responsible for the luggage. Wait, so we get to deal with Aegean again? Wonderful! I called and a kind man explained exactly what to do and gave me an email. In less than a day I got a response telling me exactly what to do to make a very easy process go smoothly. I've spent three weeks with United and got nowhere, while being treated rudely. In the last few days everything has been submitted to Aegean in a easy process with a kind person on the other end helping.

When my sister and I checked in for the Santorini to Athens flights we had two rollerbags which were labeled cabin baggage on check in by Aegean. (A355 3 June) On our continuing flight to London (A3602 3 June), the gate agent stopped us and demanded that we pay 60 euros for one of our carryons despite the fact they were tagged by Aegean on our previous connecting flight. He would not let us on the plane unless we paid him. We finally paid to not hold up other travelers but in the confusion of this my purse was left on his counter. (not the main check in counter but the one to the side of the door where he collected the money). Immediately upon getting to my seat I noticed the purse missing. I asked the three stewardesses at the front of the plane if I could retrieve my purse at that counter. The man charging us the baggage fee at the last minute could also have run the purse down, and didn't. I could not leave the plane to go up the ramp but they did not offer for one of them to get it for me; and instead waited for a young baggage boy to go see it it was there. What could have been accomplished in 5 minutes took at least 15 or more. He came back and said he did not see it. Literally, it was only 5 minutes from the time we got to our seat to when I could have had a stewardess check the countertop. The attendants could have called the gate but didn't or one of them gone to that counter, but they did not. On arrival at Heathrow, the departure agent called Athens for me and the purse was at lost and found with greek police at airport. They had it at the ticket check in stand after all! They gave me the reference number of 2294 and said to call DHL (maybe UPS) to have it couriered to me. I am not a business and have no way of putting the purse (small fabric dark grey shoulder bag 10 x 12"") in a box with a label which was suggested for pickup. Aegean Air, when contacted, said I would have to go through Greek lost and found and could offer no further assistance. I will pay if needed for it to be sent. I obviously am not in Athens and do not know anyone to pick the purse up for me there. The ticket agent in London was helpful but all of the numbers I have tried to reach since then either don't respond or give me another number that doesn't respond. He also said we should not have been charged the 60 euros at the last minute on the continuing flight. After calls and emails the airline finally did say they would credit the charge.

Although I have accumulated a great deal of spending miles, it seems I cannot spend any since in order to find free slots, I have to foresee a trip many months before and it has to not fall within their busy periods, making it pretty impossible to spend them. Even if you want to use the miles to fly 2-3 months ahead, you have to be willing to fly with other star alliance carriers and through other destinations (transit), hence doubling your flight time and hassle. I am a silver card holder (need one more flight to become gold), and I am entitled to 2 upgrades per year from economy to business class. Whenever I try to use these upgrades there never seem to be any available slots/seats. Then a year passes and these vouchers expire.

I flew on Aegean from Athens to Cairo, a direct flight and when I arrived in Cairo I received a text informing me that my bag did not arrive in Cairo with me. When I checked my bag that morning 2.5 hours before my flight was scheduled to depart, the rude airline employee put my bag on the conveyor belt after tagging it. The belt stopped and reversed, the bag came back, and I asked the Aegean rep. why. She said without looking at me, ""It's overweight! Take it go over there!"" and then she ignored me. I said, ""I just flew yesterday with your airline and the bag weighed 20.3 kg and there is nothing new in it."" She kept ignoring me so I went to a different line, where I waited for 30 minutes to be told my bag was not overweight and indeed did weigh 20.3 kg. In Cairo, when I found out my bag had not arrived, I saw that most of the other passengers on my flight had not gotten theirs either. In fact, I later learned that Aegean Airlines had misplaced or lost the luggage of passengers of five different flights in two days! I had to fill out a form and get a complaint number. I expected to hear from the airline that day telling me they had located my bag, but that didn't happen. The next day I got a message from WorldTracer, a luggage tracing service, that my bag had been located ""pending confirmation."" For an entire week that message remained on the site. I had one email from Aegean Airlines customer service department informing me the day after my flight that my bag had been located and was being flown to Cairo but that proved not to be true. I emailed and called Aegean Airlines and never got a straight answer about where my bag was. I got emails that told me to ""rest assured"" that they were doing everything they could to resolve the problem. They never returned my calls and only repeated information about being reimbursed for ""first needs"" for up to 40 euros per day. The list of information they needed to approve reimbursement was ridiculously long. Finally, a week later and only minutes after speaking with another Aegean Airlines customer services rep. and being told they didn't know the whereabouts of my luggage but were doing everything they could to find it, I got an email from the lost luggage office in Cairo airport telling me my bag had been delivered there and I could pick it up. It cost me two taxi rides and five hours to retrieve my bag from the airport. I spent a week not knowing if I'd ever see my belongings again. Deeply regrettably, I still have one flight ahead of me with this terrible airline and I dread turning over my belongings to them. When I asked them for an upgrade for that flight, they told me they weren't able to do that. I'm sorry I can't change my flight.",Aegean Airlines,,,

The flight to Prague is not using a gateway to the aircraft, but a bus. There is still a priority to Gold and Silver members, for no reason in that case, since everyone will get on a bus. Also, another thing that I had complained in the past in the company's support contact form, is about other's passenger's cabin luggage, which in many are too big in comparison with the proper aircraft cabin luggage.

P Kannigatis (United Kingdom) 8th October 2018",Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  As a Gold Member I fly regularly with Aegean and can compliment the timeliness, friendliness and professionalism of staff. I have been flying regularly from London to Thessaloniki via Athens (approx. 16 flights a year). On this occasion I was more than disappointed. The flight was delayed (not the airlines fault) but the crew did not seem to be interested in the comfort of staff. On several occasions elderly passengers struggled to place their luggage in the overhead bin and received no assistance from crew who stood by and watched. I was surprised by this as I usually they always assist. Due to the delay in take off the connection time in Athens would be shorter than normal. At this point, as always, I was not worried as Aegean usually does a excellent job in handling connection flights. Upon arrival to Athens and once departing the plane the connection Ambassador was shouting for anyone going to Thessaloniki to hurry - very unwelcoming! To make it worse she then decided to start sprinting and was shouting at everyone you have to run! Run or you will not make it. Looking at my fellow passengers who were mostly elderly this was more than unacceptable. My partner as well, due to an injury could not keep up. I told the member of staff to calm down and take it slow but she kept shouting to run and hurry. At this point I decided to proceed on my own with my partner to the gate and we made it in plenty of time before boarding had even started. Never have I experienced such rude behavior and such unnecessary stress. As a connection ambassador she should have known that there was time and that we would have easily made it to the gate with time left to spare. Instead everyone was pushed to walk at a fast pace with people struggling and no one taking notice. Aegean needs to review this and ensure the ground staff offer a good connecting experience with staff making sure everyone reaches their next flight in comfort. Even with the bad experience I can only recommend the airline and all they have achieved but find it necessary to share all types of feedback.",Aegean Airlines,A321,,

We checked in just fine, gave our luggage in, went through security and arrived at the Aegean lounge within minutes. We had booked a separate seat for our son with the intention of using a car seat for him. When we showed out boarding passes to the nice lady that greeted us in the lounge we inquired about pre-boarding for families. She did not know anything about it and simple said that we would be boarding from the lounge area when an announcement is made. We also inquired about gate checking the stroller and receiving it for use at our connecting airport in Athens she did in fact state that we could take the elevator down to the bus which would take us to the aircraft for boarding and that there we could gate check the stroller to be given back to us when we arrive at the gate in Athens. When the time came we heard the announcement for boarding for our flight and as we gave our boarding passes to the same lady that greeted us on the way in, she scanned them, checked our passports and asked us to wait next to the door to take us to the elevator. After all passengers went through the door, we were asked to follow her to the elevator to find that there was a line there of approx. 6 passengers in wheel chairs waiting to use it. Also the bus that all other passengers boarded was waiting on us. At this point she asked if we could carry the child in hand to walk the stairs down to the bus, and she offered to carry the stroller down as well. Although I did appreciate the offer, this was not an ideal situation. When we got to the bus, I was holding our son, my wife was holding carry on luggage and I had to manage a folded stroller as well, all while standing in a moving bus. Perhaps if as they advertised had offered proper pre-boarding for families with young children these things could go a bit smoother. We arrived at the aircraft and gave the stroller to the person standing at the bottom of the stairs, to be returned to us when we arrived in Athens. Got on board the aircraft, started installing the car seat for my son, which thankfully did not take long. We were told by the staff on board that the child would have to be sitting on either mine or my wife's lap for take-off and landing and they provided us with a seat belt extension to use for this. As in a previous flight, I did not argue with the staff and complied. Lufthansa did not have any issues with the use of a car seat used during take-off and landing. In any case the safest place for a child under the age of 2, is securely fastened in a car seat with a 3 point harness. When we arrived at Athens and de-boarded, we asked for our car seat and they were searching for it, while the bus to take us to the terminal was waiting for us. Took them a few minutes, but they found it. One last thing that I would like to point out is the fact that the plane was late departing from Thessaloniki, and that we had a connecting flight from Athens which we barely made thanks this. The thing that made this situation even worse was the fact that the bus driver delivered us to a door all the way on the other end of the terminal were we had to go.",Aegean Airlines,A320,,

This was the first time we flew with our infant son and were really excited to be flying with Aegean as in the past we have had a very good experience with them. This time around though it was not so pleasant. We had booked three seats (all business) so that we could place a car seat on board for our 14 month old son. We expected to be boarding before all others in the plane thus having plenty of time to put our things away and to install the car seat in the seat and securing our son. This was not the case. When it came time to board they announced boarding for business class customers so a whole lot of people lined up in front of us - no pre-boarding for families was offered as advertised on their website. When we got into the jet-way we were greeted by an Aegean Airlines employee who asked us about the car seat being checked to the final destination. We explained that we had purchased a seat for this, he demanded to see 4 boarding passes. Yes - 4 boarding passes, one for me, one for my wife, one for my son, and one for the car seat. I remember thinking you have got to be kidding me. After a few minutes of explaining to him that we had purchased 3 seats and one was for an infant with the intention of using a car seat for safety and after he said he had to check with the staff on board we were allowed to board. All 3 of us (or 4 of us according to that employee). So at this point all other passengers were boarding, so I had to wait for the car seat install until all passengers were on board - not an ideal situation. Furthermore we were told that we could not use the car seat during take-off and landing and the child had to sit on either myself or my wife using a seat belt attachment which they provided. At this point I was really not in any mood to argue with anyone and I did as they requested. We had our son sitting on our lap for take-off and landing instead of him being safely secured in car seat with a 3-point harness.

The only interesting comment I can make about the flight down, was the landing, let's just say it was a copilot landing. The best part of the trip was the return flight. Those of us who have traveled to Heraklion, know that the airport is a pit of pain and agony. I will address this issue, in a separate review,for things have changed. With Aegean they have there own separate check in counter, and a self check in, away from the madding charter craziness. Checkin was completed in 10 minutes! This was just fantastic!

M James (United Kingdom) 23rd May 2018",Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified | This review is about my recent trip with a friend from Athens (ATH) to Tel Aviv in the Aegean business class. 1) Athens airport: The airport in Athens has several lounges. Having a Star Alliance Gold card, we checked-out the Lufthansa lounge in the Schengen area before we made our way to the Aegean Lounge in the Non-Schengen area. Both lounges are above standard, but the Aegean lounge is better and we especially enjoyed the smoothies and sweets. Considering it is the flagship lounge of Aegean at their main hub, I wonder why it does not have shower facilities and an area to relax/sleep. On the other hand Aegean focusses on short- and medium-haul flights and does not find it necessary. 2) Seat: It would be great if Aegean would have a real business class chair. But like most – if not all – European airlines the business class had regular economy class seats with the middle seat being blocked by a table. The armrests could be moved sideways so the seat was wider. The seats in the first row offer enough legspace – only the emergency exit row in economy class has more legspace. There were no power outlets in the seat. 3) Onboard product: We found it nice that we were given menu and a wine carte. In addition to the meals offered onboard, business class passengers can pre-order other local dishes as well as special meals. I pre-ordered the Moussaka and it was really good. The airplane had overhead monitors were a film about Greece was shown. No WiFi and no personal device entertainment. 4) Verdict: Aegean offers a very good business class product compared to other European airlines. Seats should have power outlets. We were on vacation so power outlets and wifi were not that important to us. The onboard service is above standard and that is what was important to us.",Aegean Airlines,,2,1

The airplane was full and we had seats (aisle and middle) in the back of the plane. The seat spacing was comparatively very small. Onboard service: Even in economy, we were offered a full meal.

A text from them told me they cancelled our flights due to 'Operational Requirements' 6 weeks before our holiday and to ring them. They offered night flights several days later or to travel 5.5 hours to fly from Heathrow. Work, Pre-booked Trains. hotels and ferries meant we had to travel on that day from Manchester as Heathrow was £300 more for us to get there at short notice. At no point were they going to meet extra travel costs or compensate the 4 of us in any way other than refund our flights which we have had to do. Why they didn't provide a coach to transport people from Manchester - Heathrow I don't know and the unsympathetic attitude to our prearranged details astounded us. The result is we are flying with an alternative airline at a cost of £500 more per couple. Customer Services are next to useless and online only as there's nobody you can talk to in person. I'm still awaiting my refund which they say will take 10-15 working days. Today it's come to our attention that they're operating a flight out of Manchester on the morning our flight was due to depart via Brussels which would get us to Athens at a similar time to what we should have arrived. Upon bringing this to their attention and asking why we weren't offered this option they say they use Aegean Flights only in these situations. The first leg was operated by Brussels Airlines and the second part being Aegean themselves. They sell the flights, there was room on the flights yet we were not offered the option of them even though it would've been the easy alternative. It's the last time we'll fly with them.

You can pick any meal during booking through their site. Bread also served, refreshments or wine, coffee, juice etc. Crew were always smiling. Normal economy seat size is very decent. They offer the option of paying to get a ""front seat"" with extra leg room. I have done it in the past and it was worth the 15-20 euros needed. This time I went for a simple seat at the rear of the aircraft, space was decent. I would not complain really, this is a very competitive fare price.

Nobody informed us that I could ask for free meals and drinks and I didn't take most of the receipts. You did send sms messages about the delay but no messages about free meals/drinks. Compensation for a 4.50 euros receipt for meals/drinks for two persons doesn't seem right. At least you didn't accept the 5 euros extended parking time which was caused by the departure delay. The total amount of money (9.50 euros) is insignificant for a company like Aegean.

I have flown with Aegean many times before, mostly in Business Class and their service has been consistently good. On this occasion though there were problems. Aegean offer 4 free seat upgrades to their Gold flyers and 2 upgrades to their Silver flyers. This means a lot of passengers flying Business class for ""free"". On my flight there were 16 passengers in C class, 50% of which were free upgrades. One FA only was assigned to this cabin and as a result the service was far below expectations. The FA could not provide the service required on time or at the level it should be. For example, drinks were coming very slowly and the starter and main were served at the same time which is very unusual for Aegean on this route. By the time I finished my starter, the main was too cold. Also, passengers in C class were putting their feet up on the back of the front seat with the FA allowing it without any sort of comment. Certainly not a good experience this time. I have flown many times with Aegean, I recommend them and I consider them one of the best airlines in Europe. However, if they want to take the extra step and get another star they need to sort out some small things like these upgrades. Maybe reduce them? Do they need them for Silver members?

I decided to finally write a review, seeing the consistency of service - a single positive or negative experience can be attributed to chance, but I think safer conclusions can be drawn after having the same experience time after time after time. And my experience of Aegean Airlines has always been stellar. The plane was clean, in good condition (this time I flew with one of their new A320ceo - those with ""sharklets"" at the wing tips), inspiring reliability. The crew were friendly in a genuine way - it's amazing how easy it is to spot fake smiles - and gave the impression they truly care for the passengers. Leg room must be among the best, I've never felt squeezed in an Aegean plane. In-flight service is miles ahead of anyone else. You get a warm meal with drinks (including alcoholic ones, such as wine or beer), coffee/tea, before-take-off candy, and there were even gifts for children.  I'm baffled by some people who claim Aegean's in-flight entertainment is lacking, and I applaud Aegean's decision to show instead a truly beautiful video displaying the many places worth visiting in Greece. Flight-deck crew provide information to the passengers along the way.  All in all, it's hard to find any flaws. If I absolutely had to pick something, I'd say that sometimes the aisle seems a bit clogged - probably as a result of the cabin crew being busy serving passengers. I think Aegean fully deserves its ""best regional airline"" designation, as you get a lot of value for your money. Their prices are more than reasonable, and when you realize how much you get for what you pay, the result is totally worth it.

ATH - MJT was a full flight and about 35 mins in the air with a drinks service followed by a breakfast snack service followed by coffee tea service (those cabin crew were constantly on the move and smiling). One thing that I'm not keen on is the pre allocated seating which is a pain especially if you want a specific seat (extra leg room, I'm 6' 6""). From LHR to ATH I logged on for check in as soon as it opened and there were only approx 13 other seats to select and from ATH to LHR approx 18 seats. Fortunately got an extra legroom seat on outbound but inbound had to ask an agent at the airport if a seat had become available. After a bit of tapping away she gave me extra legroom seats on both inbound flights (very appreciated). Please can we go back to selecting our own seats? Boarding is the usual chaos with no one taking any notice of the announcements (if they're boarding passengers seated at the back you can bet those with seats at the front will go through too) but it's no big deal and in no way reflects on the airline.

L Martins (United States) 31st March 2017",unk,✅ Verified Review |  Tel Aviv to Madrid via Athens. I give kudos to Aegean for having a specific section on their booking website for indicating the disability of a passenger but it is regrettable that they don't make better use of the information provided. My wife is blind and travels with a guide dog. While US airlines are very good at making accommodations for guide dogs our experience is that European airlines have less understanding of reasonable accommodation. I recognize that Aegean does not have a typical bulkhead that allows a little more space for an assistance dog and they did block out the center seat on both flights on check in but instead of providing a seat in the first few rows of coach we were placed in row 18 and row 19 on the legs between Tel Aviv and Athens and Athens and Madrid respectively. Being right in the center of the plane meant that it was necessary to negotiate a much longer stretch of the narrow center corridor for embarkation and disembarkation and much more difficult access to bathroom facilities. The odd thing was that after completing my reservation online I called Aegean and was specifically assured that we would be placed in the first row of coach class. Obviously a wasted call because when we got to the airport we were told they had no seats set aside for us and were even unsure if they would even be able to block out the center seat on the second leg. Aegean would do well to take some lessons from Delta or American on how to handle guide dogs. The other issue I had was that the plane was way to hot!! On both flights I asked if the temperature could be lowered. I was informed that the ends of the plane were maintained at 24 degrees C which meant that the center of the plane got much hotter and they would not lower the temperature to better serve the center because they would then get complaints about the plane being too cold. Whereas if the plane is too cold a person can add additional clothing but if the plane is too hot then if one is already down to shirt sleeves ther is not much else one can take off and remain decent. Obviously this is a serious design flaw with the equipment with the equipment that is used by Aegean but perhaps they should re-examine the cabin temperature they maintain so that people in the center of the plane don't have to endure excessive heat. The overall rating I am giving is for the issues discussed above. Without these two unfortunate circumstances my rating would be an 8 or 9!,Aegean Airlines,A321,,

I used the economy check in and after 20 minutes in the queue I was told by the airport staff that unfortunately Aegean pay to have their business class check in open for less time than all other airlines in T2 and so it would open later. Shocking! Aegean, if you can't afford to have business class check in open, do not sell business class tickets or do not fly to Heathrow. Also, when arrived in Athens, once again the A321 full with over 200 passengers and in the middle of a storm, parked at a remote stand rather than at an air bridge. This seems to be common practice for Aegean and the excuse that all air bridges are occupied is simply not true because on this occasion nearly all of them were free. Aegean are clearly cutting corners but their fares are still very high. Their level of service though has dropped significantly to the point that it will cost them passengers.

On the flight to Belgrade we were served a sandwich which was at least twice bigger than its competitor on the route, but as much lower in quality. It was basically a bread-bun.

Attention to detail and consistent service. No IFE, nice legroom and a good meal on longer flights. Boarding in ATH 80% of the time being done at remote stands like low-cost carriers, even in cold and windy weather. Luggage policy seldomly applied, at some stations strict one-bag policy as Wizz Air / Ryanair, at others no one pays attention. No proper business class. Poor quality meal on shorter flights.

Bobby Giannakopoulos (Canada) 29th September 2016",unk,Athens to Geneva. I've flown on Aegean Airlines before and never had any problems. I did my check in online but I couldn't complete it as I had a booking on stand by. The waiting for the check in Athens airport was not very long and it was very reasonable. I asked to tag my bag to my final destination because I had a different booking to Montreal with Air Canada which is a partner airline. The system didn't let it even if the check in lady try to do so. Probably because my booking was on stand by. However she put a priority tag on my bag which ended to come out fast in Geneva. The flight was quite full with very few seats left. The cabin crew was not very interacting with passengers. The service onboard was good and a hot meal was provided with a choice of drinks all free of charge. The inflight entertaiment was a video featuring some tourist attractions of some Greek islands. Overall Aegean airlines is a good and it offers a good range of destinations but they're limited only to Europe and some destinations to the Middle East.

All things being relatively equal, from all available carriers on the Paris-Athens route, A3 is definitely my airline of choice. A few random things, which I'd like to emphasize: 1) Cabin crew are impeccably behaved and presented and always ready to accommodate my requests. 2) Air-fi which was provided on my last flights is quite interesting and compensates for the lack of individual screens in the cabin. I only hope that its content will be constantly updated and enriched (it would be a disappointment, if on my next flight in 10 days I'd be obliged to browse through the same material again) 3) Reserving front W.C. only for business class passengers (typically 8-12 per flight, which is on or about 5% of the plane's seating capacity) does not make a lot of sense and occasionally creates lots of discomfort to economy class passengers. Without undermining the premium service afforded to business class passengers, Aegean could consider a derogation to this policy. 4) As a miles and bonus silver member, I'm looking forward to upgrade to the golden tier soon. As a silver member however, I believe that A3 should reconsider silver tier's benefits and in particular the coupons for complimentary access to business class lounges so that they are offered not only in Greek airports but also to int'l ones as well. All in all my experience with Aegean has been positive since it's reliable, efficient, modern and has by far the most pleasant and professional cabin crew.

The food was standard regional economy affair - pre-packed snacks and nothing exciting, and there was a reasonable selection of drinks. The cabin was clean, and relatively new. The seats were much better than what I'd expect in short-haul economy. As a gold member I was able to book a seat in the first six rows, which has much more generous seat pitch despite being in economy. Because of the slimness of the seats, even seats further down the plan had plenty of legroom. The only criticism is disembarkation in Athens. Apparently most ( if not all) Aegean flights park on the tarmac, and you need to get on a bus to get to the terminal. This obviously takes more time than desirable, but a small drawback in otherwise an great airline.",Aegean Airlines,A320,,

I liked the magazine holder at the back of the top of the seats (where the TV screen would be on other aircrafts). The toilet facilities were clean. The price of the flight was pretty cheap, 23 kilos of check in luggage was an additional 20 pounds, and the service was excellent. The first leg of the flight was 1 hour 40 mins - during that time you are provided with complimentary refreshments (including alcohol) after take off. You are then provided with a traditional Greek snack, 2 cheese pies and a fig bar, followed by further refreshments. The food was lovely and of a high standard. All the packaging is recyclable.  On the second leg we received the same excellent service and provided with a delicious tomato and pasta bake and fig bar. Also loved the simplicity of the meals and that they were vegetarian.

I stayed and waited at the line for over two hours while she ""claimed"" they were looking for my luggage. She actually blamed me in part because she stated she did not have eyes in the back of her head. I did not speak any Italian so I know she said so not nice words to her coworkers. After two hours waiting, she came up to me and said they found my bag and had a green luggage tag printed out. I said good then she said I still had to pay $40. I was shocked. At no time did she apologize. So I am in Greece with no luggage for over a week. I went on a Cruise with one outfit, luckily my roommate let me borrow a dress. The hotel staff in Athens provided me with tooth brush and tooth paste. My entire vacation was ruined because of the ticket person lying and said they found my luggage.

The boarding was pleasant enough, the staff helpful and friendly and the seats comfortable and well spaced. My only complaint was that we had the rearmost seats of the business section and we were unfortunate enough to have small children behind us continually banging and pushing our seats. The major complaint was the food. I am sure that they had been let down by the supplier and had to find something in a hurry, especially as the food on the outward flight was very good. The starters consisted of shredded lettuce which looked to be old and mixed in with it were pieces of anchovy and a few pieces of tomato. Judging by the left overs of other passengers, I was not the only one to find this unappetising. When the mains were served, things got worse. We were given the choice of meat or fish and I opted for meat. I have no idea what this meat was, but the meat was swimming in a weak gravy amongst a lot of peas. I did try the meat but a small taste was enough. Again, the left overs on other passenger's trays told its own story.

ATH-ARN was again great legroom and also served a hot breakfast. For what we pay it is great value, far better than many other competing airlines, the planes are also new and clean. Only drawback is that there is no entertainment provided on the 3 hr flight, why not show a movie?",Aegean Airlines,A320 / A321,,

Staff are friendly and multi-lingual (at least 3 languages on top of Greek).  Food is well above average and so is legroom.  But bring a book or some entertainment - no in-flight entertainment on this 3.5 hour flight.  But overall, I was very impressed. Would happily fly with them again and recommend to friends.",Aegean Airlines,,,

Aircraft's were always clean service was fine food above average and quite good compared to other regular European airlines and the staff was always courteous and friendly. There were only couple times out of the last maybe 30 round trips the flight was delayed and that happened summertime when the European skies are congested. I have great respect for this airline and how nicely developed to become one of the best regional airlines of Europe.,Aegean Airlines,,3,
637,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,4,8,Aegean Airlines customer review,Sean Kyte (United Kingdom) 4th June 2015,unk,Flew from Athens to Santorini and back. Flight was an hour late leaving Athens due to congestion at Santorini return was 30 minutes late. Cabin was very clean crew friendly and impressed that a snack was offered onboard when returning to Athens. Due to turbulence when flying to Santorini the crew could not offer the inflight service so this was handed out when leaving the aircraft. Traveled with 6 month old baby and our bags got priority tags so this sped up the airport experience. Overall an excellent airline and would like to experience them on a longer journey.,Aegean Airlines,,,

Food was OK; a little on the plain side. Service was very good and superbly efficient despite both flights being at capacity but the crew could smile a little more. At least as good as BA and a step up from KLM AF or Lufthansa for regional flights - very pleasantly surprised.,Aegean Airlines,,,

Online check-in was quick just had to get boarding passes and to drop off bags at the airport. Despite having a bus gate boarding was organised very well and the flight departed ahead of schedule. The seats were quite comfortable and legroom was acceptable for this short flight. There was a small hot meal of pasta on the flight as well as a small dessert and drinks. Sweets were distributed before the main meal service. The red wine served on board was very good. Of note are the cabin crew who were very friendly and went around their work with smiles on their faces - this is rare these days with most airlines. The entertainment consisted of short videos on Greek island destinations and was ok though there was no audio available. Arrival into Prague on time and bags were processed within 15 minutes after leaving the aircraft. All in all Aegean is a hidden gem of an airline - I had a very good experience with Aegean and I would be glad to fly them again when I can.,Aegean Airlines,,3,

Flights were all on time and the crew were great. They were short flights so no inflight entertainment and only a drink which was all that was needed. On our landing in Santorini we did a ""go around"". About 50feet from a touchdown the pilot powered up and off we went. The pilot came on the PA and advised us of a change in wind direction and all was good. First time for me and very exciting. Great that the pilot kept us up to date and well informed.

New slim line seats with hard seatback and short cushion that doesn't properly support thighs so you are forced to sit in a very unnatural and cramped position. The further back on the plane the smaller legroom gets i.e. new seats + seat in the back = nightmare while older seats in front of the cabin are very comfortable. Apart from that pleasant flights with good service hot pasta meal on TXL-ATH small though but at least one of the few remaining airlines to serve warm meals on intra- european flights. Even on the short ATH-CHQ hop they serve drinks and a cake. As they charge extra fees for every checked bag people carrying incredible amounts of luggage into the cabin making boarding a bit chaotic. Cabin baggage restrictions should be enforced.,Aegean Airlines,,3,

651,,Business Class,,,no,2,4,4,,1,3,Aegean Airlines customer review,M Kapsalis (Greece) 4th March 2015,unk,Athens to Abu Dhabi Business. Business class is a waste of money. There is the middle seat which is not available thus giving more room to the other 2 side passengers. No comfort seats no video system no amenities no nothing. Food was just ok stuff was kind and helpful. My advice: Beware of Aegean flights out of Europe as these are just seasonal. If they find that they have many empty seats left they will cancel the flight. I should fly Etihad economy. Its cheaper than Aegean business more reliable and has the same amenities except food.,Aegean Airlines,,1,
652,,Business Class,,,no,2,4,3,,2,3,Aegean Airlines customer review,Michalis Kapsalis (Greece) 4th March 2015,unk,I booked to Abu Dhabi Business. One month before departure they informed me that my returned flight was canceled because Aegean had canceled all Abu Dhabi flights after November. I asked for a replacement ticket with their partner Etihad but they told me they can't do that. So they gave me some money back and made me buy another return ticket for 300 euros. The business class has little to do with business class. Apart from the food it looks like economy class. The only difference is that there is a reclined table at the middle seat shared by the two side passengers. No personal entertainment system either just newspapers. I have noticed that many routes are operated by Aegean only seasonally so beware they may cancel your flight anytime if they see that they have not many reservations. Overall definitely a budget airline nothing more.,Aegean Airlines,,,
653,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,4,8,Aegean Airlines customer review,Russell Ng (Malaysia) 4th March 2015,unk,I flew to Heraklion and Aantorini from Athens in February. Seats are fine with decent leg room unfortunately there's no proper inflight entertainment on the flight. The service carried out by the cabin crew are professional and efficient. My return flight from Heraklion was delayed due to some technical difficulties. But we still managed to arrive in Athens on time. My flight to Santorini was short so they couldn't really carry out the full service but they still manage to give us cookies and fresheners. I would definitely take Aegean again on my next journey to Greece.,Aegean Airlines,,2,

I must say that the professionalism of the cabin crew was excellent. Although the flight was very short the cabin crew were smiling warm hearted to everyone and even at a time when they had to deal with a passenger that was demanding for more and more alcohol the cabin crew dealt with it with professionalism defusing the situation without embarrassing the passenger. I would definitely choose Aegean again for my trips.,Aegean Airlines,,4,

I got the 22.15 flight from Heathrow to Athens on the 13th and then the 09.15 flight to Chania on the 14th. At Heathrow the flight was over-subscribed so they were offering people a large sum of money a night in a hotel and the flight the following day - I wish they would have asked me! Then they were asking people to (voluntarily) check their hand luggage into the hold - so I offered because of the long wait I had at ATH! The flight was smooth the hot meal was served early on into the flight and we landed slightly early. The only criticisms I have is that the seats are a little hard and the cabin was stiflingly hot and very bright! Great to have a free meal though. On arrival at Athens at 03.40 I collected my hand luggage and checked into an airport lounge before my flight to Chania - which was well worth the £20! Flight to Chania was a bit poorly organised but landed on time. Return flights were also very good and a mercifully shorter stop over in Athens!,Aegean Airlines,,4,

Aegean had been informed she required a wheelchair and we received confirmation it was booked both ways. From Rhodes to London they had no details regarding the chair and had to rush around looking for one. Apart from that initial problem my mother informed me everything was fine however on the day of her return Aegean decided to go on strike thankfully they messaged although it was 10 'o' clock at night. I tried desperately to get through eventually they put her on the following day again with confirmation of the wheelchair. London section was fine she tells me and the staff were quite attentive but on landing at Rhodes I waited outside and to my disgust saw my poor mother dragging a 20kg suitcase behind her carrying a coat and her handbag! Not one staff member offered to help she even had to ask a member of the public to lift her case from the conveyor belt.,Aegean Airlines,,3,

I then flew to Athens and then to Kos. On the 16th from Kalymnos to Athens and back to Mykonos and then on 22nd Mykonos - Athens - to Irakio Crete and then from Crete back to Athens. I must say I have had some excellent flights with Aegean. All flights on time and an excellent meal from London to Athens and this being Economy. On the internal flights you were offered a soft drink and snack. Cabin crews were extremely professional and I look forward to next October. The only downside is that: 1) They did not show any films or music available on the London flight and 2) When I booked in March I could not book the November flight home because tickets were not available so BA flew me home. I knocked a point off their food and beverages as they don't serve a gin and tonic in Economy. AS I have said I look forward to flying with them next year but they have changed the flight times to Mykonos from Athens from 7 pm to 6.30 pm which makes life difficult so they might lose this customer.,Aegean Airlines,,,
665,,Economy Class,,,no,1,4,1,,1,2,Aegean Airlines customer review,C Bartzelis (Greece) 6th November 2014,unk,I have travelled from Athens to Tirana every week for the past two years and I see it more as a torture rather than a journey. It all starts from the arrival in the airport where Aegean counters for Business travelers and gold miles card holders are filled with people which means at least 30’mins waiting for your check in. The return journey to Tirana is being carried out with a DE HAVILLAND 8-400 airplane with very little space for passenger seats. Aegean is allowing everyone to have more than one piece of hand luggage therefore you have to fight for an overhead space in this tiny airplane otherwise you will end up with the luggage under you tiny seat. Finally this journey costs only 260 euro (return) if you don't check in any luggage otherwise you have to add roughly 80 euro to the price.,Aegean Airlines,,,

Me and my family have been using Aegean Airlines for years and we have always been happy with the service. I was disappointed to find out that they have stopped playing movies during flights. On my return flight from Athens to London last week there was entertainment system at all. No music no movies. I think this is the last time I will use Aegean. Very boring flight.,Aegean Airlines,,1,

The airline offered sweets on take-off small snack and drink on Kos-Athens which is just a 40 minute flight! The drinks service are repeated twice on Athens-LHR flight and the meals are adequate. Well worth £70 one way and into Heathrow! I would definitely fly them again. Seating is okay for 3 hours 30 minutes and flight seems to go fast as the cabin crew are constantly busy with the passengers. Probably a budget IFE system needs adding for a little more enjoyment!,Aegean Airlines,,,

During my last trip to Athens for the outbound flight they put two flights together - as a result I was not able to change flights online. Hence I had to call them up in order to change flights they inform that I had to pay an extra 65 euros if I wanted to fly in a particular flight and 20 euro if I wanted to fly with another flight. I told them that this is a business ticket and I can change whenever I want to the could not care less. Hence I have decided not to fly with them again.,Aegean Airlines,,,

Not enough seats in airport lounge. No drinks provided. Only given a cookie. Travellers allowed to take extra hand luggage onto flight so there was not enough room for people who only had the one designated bag. We then had our return flight - we called the airline and asked if possible could we get on an earlier flight back to Athens if there were sears available. We were told seats were available most of the earlier flights however it would cost us euro 112 per person to catch the earlier flight. Offered us a 20% discount on a full new fare. Online price was only euro 117 to 131. We had initially purchased the two seats for euro 300. This spoilt our European vacation. We could understand a small penalty to changed however to charge a complete new ticket when there were empty seats available and there are numerous flights back and forth from Santorini to Athens.,Aegean Airlines,,1,

Seating pitch satisfactory - mediocre width (middle seat unoccupied - turned to table). Lavatory clean. Full satisfactory hot meal (choice of main course) with a Mediterranean accent freshly brewed espresso coffee. Actually no in flight entertainment - drop down overhead TV screens with safety instructions and flight path information.

Departed on time and despite the fact that it was such a short flight a full drink service was offered with a variety of soft drinks napkins ice and a bag of peanuts and everyone was served. Upon landing in ATH the goodbye and thanks you greeting was polite with a smile. An excellent flight. 3 hour layover at Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport Athens was a breeze. Was given an invite to the Aegean Business Lounge on the A side of the departure terminal which was comfortable with the usual drinks and snacks available and regularly topped up. Nice clean lounge with a view of both runways. ATH-LHR Aegean Business. Departed ATH with 15 minute delay clean Airbus A321-200 aircraft. Good PA announcements by Purser and Captain. Comfortable leather seats with middle seat free. Drink service and peanuts after take off with hot towel service. Menu was provided with a choice of 2 hot main meals of chicken or swordfish with a delicious salmon entree and a selection of delicious Greek desserts. A good choice of wines including award winning Greek varieties plus the usual soft after dinner and a good selection of teas and coffees. Hot towel service again before landing. Landed on time. A very impressive service offered by Aegean. Have no hesitation about using them again.,Aegean Airlines,,4,

I bought a ticket with Aegean to Paros. It turns out that the flight is operated by Olympic Air - not a Star Alliance member - and therefore some of my privileges do not apply. I can still have more luggage but I can not use the lounge. The Aegean representative refused to issue an invitation to the Aegean lounge since ""it would cost them extra money"" while I thought I had this privilege included in my ticket bought with Aegean. Nothing about reduced privileges was mentioned when I bought the ticket. Aegean did not want to do anything to accommodate the urgent need of a passenger with a Senator Gold card of Star Alliance who had to use the internet in their lounge for an emergency.",Aegean Airlines,,,

The plane was new and clean the service was excellent and what a treat to have a hot meal on a European flight. On leaving the plane at Athens we were told to contact the ground staff immediately as we had a very short connection time. We did so and the ground staff sent us onto the same bus as everybody else! Luckily the airport was not busy at 5 a.m. and we easily caught the flight to Mykonos. However a good very short flight to Mykonos and Aegean cannot be blamed for the ground crew. I would happily fly with them again.,Aegean Airlines,,,

Once we were on the flight the toilets were locked at the front and we couldn't get past the air hostesses to use the toilets at the back. States in Aegan Airlines T&C of delayed flights that we are meant to get some form of contact from the airline within 7 days. 3 weeks later we still have yet to hear from them.,Aegean Airlines,,1,

Aegean have introduced these hopeless self check in machines. Having already checked in online and printed our boarding passes we ignored the machines at Heathrow and went straight to the desk where the assistant refused to serve us until we had used a machine. But this would not recognise our name booking reference or passport numbers. We tried again and again until eventually another member of staff sorted it for us. Not a good start as far as we were concerned I was fuming. Returning from Athens we encountered exactly the same problems with a check in machine there. This time even an assistant failed to operate the terminal and she subsequently instructed us to join a lengthy queue. Reaching the front 15 minutes later we were told we were in the wrong queue it was the Olympic desk and not Aegean which was the next one along. Our plea that we were in the queue we had been instructed to join by a member of staff was met with no sympathy whatsoever. With us on the verge of going ballistic the person at the correct desk was thankfully sympathetic and helpful. Everything on our flights was as expected though I must comment that there was less legroom than I have ever before experienced on a plane. As a tall person (5 ft 11 in / 180 cm inside leg 33 in / 84 cm) I spent the entire flight with my knees jammed firmly either side of the seat in front of me and unable to move.,Aegean Airlines,,2,

Seat comfort very basic no magazines no monitors absolutely nothing. Very old noisy aircraft. I booked through the official homepage of Aegean and was very disappointed about this awful downgrading. Nevertheless the cabin Crew of Swiftair (except one Supervisor all Spaniards) did an acceptable job. The inbound flight ZRH to ATH was one hour late. But at least it was an Aegean aircraft.

Tea and a choice of coffees were available and the usual soft drinks. Cabin crew were very polite and pleasant helpful and offered service with a smile. A Singapore Airlines style service.

Full marks for flexibility without compromising security or delaying the flight and that extra effort made such a difference and saved me from a nightmarish situation of cancelled onward flights and hotel.

This airline is intended to be a regular airline however it behaves like a low-cost one. You have to pay to check in a luggage in addition to the normal fare. Seat spacing is comparable to a low cost such as Ryanair quite insufficient. Food is average but more importantly it is presented in cardboard boxes which are recycled. Choice of beverages is very limited. Unfortunately Aegean is in a monopolistic situation in Greece and they are expensive and cost/satisfaction of service is below average.,Aegean Airlines,,1,

Flying from Larnaca to Athens flight arrived on time to the destination seat space was ok food was horrible. Inflight service very average. Nobody expects anything special flying economy regarding food but what Aegean served for breakfast was beyond words. A tasteless omelette there was liquid coming out of it plus a small chocolate. The second segment of my flight from Athens to Brussels was better in leg space service and food but I find unacceptable the control they have on hand luggage. Lately they introduced the low fare tickets for people travelling with just hand luggage people of course try to benefit from this. Passengers carry in the cabin what they would otherwise have checked at the check in counters! What is happening is that people carry oversized suitcases and try to fit them in the overhead storage holders and I was really surprised to see that they allow this. I was carrying a 6 kg soft handbag which I placed in the overhead holder above my seat and the air hostess asked me if she could move it in a holder further in the other row simply to fit a big suitcase! The most positive aspect to this airline is the convenient times.,Aegean Airlines,,3,
711,,Economy Class,,,no,2,5,2,,3,6,Aegean Airlines customer review,N Simonis (Greece) 7th February 2014,unk,Aegean is really unpredictable. Can be excellent in every way or disappointing in many other ways. For example though their fares are in no way low cost they started charging 20 euros for a piece of luggage each way (short haul) and 30 euros for longer flights i.e. to Spain. BA and CY do not charge. Going out to BCN cost me for 2 pax 95 euros more than for our return flight on Vueling. Of course Vueling offers no breakfast (you have to pay for it) yet breakfast on Aegean was as poor as you can imagine. Yes on this flight they used the good jet steps and not their favourite bus transport to - from aircraft. One thing that is really impressive is the inflight attendants exceptionally professional.,Aegean Airlines,,,

715,,Economy Class,,,no,3,3,2,,2,unk,Aegean Airlines customer review,Yvonne Bradley (Cyprus) 10th January 2014,unk,We booked and paid for a package in May 2013 to fly to Munich in Dec 2013. Flight out was with Lufthansa which was great. However when we tried to check in online the day before our return to Cyprus with Aegean through Athens we got an error message saying 'non valid ticket' and giving us a number to call. We called the number which was Lufthansa and the agent told us he could see our booking but couldn't check us in as the computer systems weren't compatible. We tried the Aegean online check in but still no joy. So we got to Munich airport 2.5 hours before our flight to check in only to be told we were on standby! We were assured that the gate personnel would sort it out to our satisfaction so we went through to the departure gates. The departure gate had changed but not updated on the terminal screen. When we finally found it the staff were very off hand about us being on standby even though we couldn't understand how we didn't have a seat when the whole thing had been booked and paid for 7 months earlier. After making a big fuss and having to wait until 5 mins before take off we finally managed to get on the plane but not seated together. Another passenger offered to swap seats so we did sit together in the end. Unfortunately we were supposed to transfer in Athens and were very concerned that we would have to go through the whole thing again and we actually refused to board the Athens plane until we were sure we had seats on the Athens to Cyprus plane. No acceptable explanation was given as to why we had been given the run-around and in fact we were made to feel that we were just making a fuss about nothing. The service on board was indifferent food was shoddy and we will never fly with Aegean again. We've flown a lot long and short haul and I can safely say this was the worst experience ever.,Aegean Airlines,,,
716,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,2,2,,3,6,Aegean Airlines customer review,K Bikos (Greece) 2nd January 2014,unk,Although I have been rooting for Aegean in the past these past months I have traveled RHO-ATH-RHO many times and each time the experience seems to be worsening. The boarding and flight schedules are perfectly fine if you ignore the constant use of a bus for boarding instead of jumping platforms in Athens but the cabin experience apart from the seat comfort which is ok is worse every time. The take off is usually ok. The trip to Rhodes lasts for approximately 50 minutes and the cabin crew are struggling to serve you. It looks as if with one hand they serve and with the other they collect what they have just served for landing. The crew are typically indifferent and tend not to smile. The catering is average but couldn't expect big things for a 50 minute flight. For now it progressively costs more money to travel with Aegean that what you actually get in return at least for these domestic routes.,Aegean Airlines,,,

Hand-luggage bought especially for cabin use and used in others budget airlines with no problem. They made me to empty it twice! For a ticket bought 9 months ago at a price of £ £420 for a flight equivalent to 3.40 hours. The plane was delayed an hour. I just managed to get my next connection flight to Mytilini because it operates from the same airline and they were waiting for us. Aegean has monopolised the local aviation. Also the time schedule is such that it is not worth it to get another airline and change to Aegean for the local trip only.,Aegean Airlines,,3,

This year on the morning of October 7th Heathrow was fog bound so the flight to Athens was delayed by two hours. This meant missing the evening flight to Mykonos. As soon as I was checking in their staff were most helpful. On arriving at Athens I was put up in Hotel Sofitel everything paid for and caught the flight to Mykonos the following morning. My only thought is that the evening flight to Mykonos is too tight with the London flight around about an hour and needs looking in to. Aegean is an excellent airline as part of my holiday flew with them to Crete as well all flights were full and I look forward to flying with them next October.,Aegean Airlines,,4,

Checked in online for all flights and seat assignments honoured. Flights arrived on time or early. Boarding a little chaotic despite very strict adherence to boarding by rows. No queue jumping was allowed if your row hadn't been called you were not allowed to board. Yet somehow chaos and confusion reigned in the cabin partly because of the amount of hand luggage some passengers had been allowed to take on board and partly because every single flight was packed solid. In flight service was excellent if a little slow. Hot meals served on international flights (ok quality) free (and good) Greek wine available and refills willingly given. Fight attendants universally pleasant and service oriented. A321 on international flights with inflight entertainment on drop down screens. A320 on domestic service.

We were stranded in Istanbul airport for 12 hours with no offer of food or drink and no concrete solution from Aegean. Eventually at 3am the morning we were given a hotel. We slept for 4 hours. We then rushed back to the airport the next morning finally guaranteed a flight and arrived back just in time for work on Monday 6am. We were suppose to be there the previous morning (Sunday). Aegean made no effort to book us decent seats leaving us to sit apart the entire journey home as a result I didn't sleep at all during the flight. Therefore I had 4 hours sleep in 48 hours and had to go straight in to work. The representative also lied to us to keep us happy until we left and could do nothing about it. We tried to call him but he refused to take our calls. The plane was really nice and comfy seats but the pilot nearly crashed upon landing. I would suspect that the reason the flight was delayed in the first place was that there was no pilot thus a stand-in pilot was used.,Aegean Airlines,,,
726,,Economy Class,,,no,4,2,4,,1,3,Aegean Airlines customer review,Y Raltseva (United Kingdom) 9th October 2013,unk,"London Stansted-Athens-Thessaloniki. Once again although cabin experience with this airline is good check-in process seems to be its weak point. Flight departed Stansted on time but just before landing at Athens I realised that I did not have a boarding pass for the connecting flight. I spoke to cabin crew about it but they seemed unaware of any issues/processes and simply referred me to the connecting flight desk at the airport. When I got there this was shut. There was no one available from the airline either and I ended up speaking to airport security. I was told that I had to come out of the airport security controlled area and check in all over again to get the boarding pass and that this is a standard procedure even though bags get transferred on to next flight automatically. There was a queue from hell at check-in which seems to be the norm for Aegean. I have never been asked to check in twice at airport for connecting flights. This then caused problems with my airport shopping not getting through security and I had to pick up my bag re-pack and hand in again. This involved a long and time- consuming process walking up and down the airport's different floors etc. Ground staff were understanding and did their best to help but there is no two ways about it: this was a very poorly ""organised"" connecting flight. I sent a form to customer service to complain but they just said that the problem was at Stansted and that they have rectified it. I asked how they have rectified it but they just responded by repeating the same. I am not convinced. A hassle-free flight with Aegean seems impossible and the overall experience does not correspond to what you pay. I would not recommend. On the way back with Air Berlin connecting at Dusseldorf did not give any problems and was a pleasure to walk past the Aegean packed check-in area knowing I didn't have to brave it.",Aegean Airlines,,4,

728,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,4,8,Aegean Airlines customer review,Bobby Giannakopoulos (Canada) 2nd October 2013,unk,ATH-PRG-ATH. All flights were smooth and on time. Check-in in Athens and Prague airport was fine and not too long. The seats on board the aircraft's were comfortable better than other airlines and the legroom was good. Inflight entertainment was nothing special. It was only the inflight map. The cabin crew and the service were very good we had a sandwich which was bigger than some other airlines with a choice of complimentary drinks for both legs. Overall Aegean Air is a very good airline as it claims to be. I would fly again with them if I have a chance. Too bad they don't fly long haul routes but they only fly regional routes.,Aegean Airlines,,3,

The aircraft an Airbus A321 was full but loading was well organised and my economy seat had decent legroom although was on the hard side. I was looking forward to my usual gin and tonic and was disappointed to discover that there was to be no drinks service on this four hour flight. The meal was eventually served on a chaotic tray the salad comprised small amounts of grated carrot and cabbage and the hot main was a pea and potato stew of strange flavour. The high-light of the meal was the small roll and cheese triangle! The bottle of red wine offered with the meal undrinkable. Two weeks earlier I had flown economy class LHR to Istanbul with British Airways and enjoyed the usual high standard of service I that I always seem to find on their flights.,Aegean Airlines,,1,

732,,Business Class,,,no,3,2,4,,3,unk,Aegean Airlines customer review,Michael Tong (Singapore) 22nd September 2013,unk,Customer service staff at Greece Airport were generally rude and sarcastic giving different versions of flight re-booking solutions. We were told we have to pay an extra 39 euros per person due to different flight cost and when we went to a different counter we were charged 20 euros per ticket as ticket amendment costs instead. In all the attitudes of the staff were very unpleasant.,Aegean Airlines,,,
733,,Economy Class,,,no,3,2,3,,3,3,Aegean Airlines customer review,P Boeck (Germany) 2nd September 2013,unk,"Return trip MUC-HER-MUC. On the return flight from Heraklion a cramped airport check-in-area full of returning holiday-makers: as a home-airport for the airline I would expect more than only one check-in being available for two simultaneously departing flights (MUC & CDG) resulting in horrible waiting queues. Additionally all passengers including those who managed to self-check-in and proceed to a ""bag-drop-desk"" had to queue a second time to take their luggage to only one open x-ray station themselves - another queuing disaster in an already overcrowded waiting hall. In total the check-in and ""bag-drop"" process on this particular flight consumed nearly two hours in cretan summer heat. I think Aegean could certainly do better by doubling the check-in-staff (opening a second counter) and making sure that passengers can actually drop their bags at the bag-drop. Making the experience even worse was a consecutive technical issue with the aircraft resulting in nearly 3 hours of waiting in an equally overcrowded terminal airside with bad information policy.",Aegean Airlines,,2,
734,,Economy Class,,,no,3,4,2,,2,6,Aegean Airlines customer review,Nicolas Simonis (Greece) 27th August 2013,unk,I have been disappointed with this airline on many occasions especially the fact that somehow they seem to hate jetsteps and they seem to favour the good old diesel buses from plane to terminal. In June after a long flight from PHL to MUC this airline was the only one to drive us around to the plane for Athens in a bus! Recent flight from LCA on 22/8 delayed 35 minutes arrived in Athens with delay. Good old bus to terminal what a pity. Aircraft seating is rather cramped for tall guys covered with plastic leather not really good for hot climates and worst of all the sandwiches were packed full with mayonnaise. Most passengers strongly complained and threw them away. Aegean could be good if they decide to eliminate such problems and make use of modern facilities not the good old diesel bus.,Aegean Airlines,,,

Venizelou Airport was not easy for this first timer and while I could chalk it up to my age other passengers were also having difficulty. At 6:30 am there weren't enough ground staff to help make the process any easier but I finally managed on my own. It has the potential to be a great improvement once the bumps are ironed out. Found seating cramped and the fact that the seats do not recline a real disadvantage. Fortunately it was only a 3 hour flight but I had counted on making up for lost sleep and that proved to be impossible.,Aegean Airlines,,,

Boarding and take-off a bit late but nevertheless it arrived as expected to Rhodes airport. Cabin was clean and shinny and the crew very friendly and looking elegant in their (well designed) uniforms. Seats fairly comfortable and all leather dressed even in economy. One thing I don't like in Aegean aircraft cabins is the seat-plan which makes the cabin feel a bit crowded in fully booked flights. Snack and drink ok nothing special for a short flight but ok. Flight was nice and smooth landing was great. Overall a pleasant and comfortable flight. I think Aegean's reputation as a quality European airline is well deserved.,Aegean Airlines,,,

Brilliant hot meal on 2 hour flight accompanied by appetizer (warm roll/butter/mini crackers/spread cheese) and selection of Greek wines in little bottles (not by glass) a dessert and two rounds of very decent coffee. Smooth landing on time. Absolutely recommended.,Aegean Airlines,,5,

The A320 was 6 years old the cabin was quite ok inside. Seems like the company's making effort to keep their planes clean. Flight attendants were just doing their job without being extra attentive. Catering included Greek cuisine and was good but not substantial - no meat was offered in the meals fine for vegetarians. Inflight entertainment meant magazines and music no TVs or anything else on that particular aircraft. The flight was on time no issues with the baggage. Overall experience is good would definitely fly again for a reasonable price.,Aegean Airlines,,3,

On this 45 mins flight the cabin crew served a cookie and all kinds of napkins (dry and refreshing) but surprisingly didn't offer any drink at all. The next flight was also on time. The catering was tasty with meat little salad and baklava. Drinks of various kinds were offered. Both times the cabin crew was smiley but didn't show much care. Baggage arrived quickly. It was also very convenient to transfer through ATH. I would recommend Aegean Airlines.,Aegean Airlines,,4,

She told me to turn it off which I had done. However I still needed to put the earphones on my ear for descent due to discomfort in my ear during that flight.

Cabin experience was good even though there was no space in the overhead lockers both ways and I ended up storing the bag under the seat which meant reduced legroom. Service on board and catering acceptable but nothing special. Food good but service disorganised and one FA asked the customer to remind another FA to bring him water! Check-in experience was the worst with a huge queue and people trying to barge in. When I raised this with staff at bag drop-off they didn't seem bothered and said they would rather use capacity for the actual desks. Overall customer service on the ground was not great. In future I am going to avoid this airline as would advise you to never try to book a flight on their website. This is meant to confuse and rip you off. I have been booking flights for my own use and for work and have never encountered such an error with the flight dates before. This is a low quality airline charging high fares.,Aegean Airlines,,1,

Both flights were satisfactory. Each one left on time. Candies were offered before take off. Snacks consisted of sandwich and yoghurt; this was for the morning flight to Prague. The evening flight from Rome also offered a sandwich and juice. Good coffee was available. The economy seats were comfortable for my Asian size. But the seat seems to be of standard size whether on an Asian American or European airline. The A320 cabins were clean. Cabin service was friendly and efficient. Check in at Fiumicino and Venizelos airports were fast and straight forward. The only inconvenience we experienced was at Athens airport. It was a late night arrival past 11pm but there was still the hassle of getting off the plane and riding a bus to the terminal. I thought all Aegean jets were not using the tube seeing several of their planes parked in the tarmac at some distance from the terminal. That wasn't the case with the morning flight to Prague as the plane was connected to a tube. Overall value for money is satisfactory. We'd choose Aegean again if an opportunity arises in the future.,Aegean Airlines,,,

The day we travelled there was a public sector strike which was no fault of the airline. However although they updated their website the day before with a list of delayed and cancelled flights ours did not appear in the list which led me to believe it would run to time. When we checked in they informed me it would run 4 hours late but still allowed us to check in our suitcases. They offered no vouchers or refreshments (which I would have thought for a delay of this length they would have to but maybe strike situations are exempt). We eventually took off 20 minutes later than the new expected departure time. The air crew were so busy talking in loud voices at the front of the cabin we couldn't hear the safety demonstration. It also meant that they did not notice the guy behind us ignoring the instruction to switch off mobile devices as he continued with his. They did however manage to hand out boiled sweets and whizz round with a drinks run which is as much as you could expect on such a short flight. The tickets were expensive considering we booked them 9 months in advance and it was a 25 minute flight.,Aegean Airlines,,,
776,,Business Class,,,no,3,1,1,,2,4,Aegean Airlines customer review,D Maguire (United Kingdom) 20th September 2012,unk,Travelled LHR-ATH Business Class then ATH-JMK (Mykonos) all Economy. Flight boarding was fine seats the usual European system with centre seat left empty and centre of the seat folded down to form a table. Was offered pre take-off drinks i.e. half a plastic glass of orange juice or one inch of sparkling white wine again in a plastic glass. The drink service was equally mean when ordering a glass of white wine less than half a glass was offered. The meal service was chaotic with only the female cabin manager looking after the 15 B/C passengers. We were booked through to Mykonos with an hours transit time (not enough). We landed and were put on a bus to the terminal then clearing immigration (bags booked through to final destination) we joined the horrendous queue for security through to the domestic flight. The queue took 40 minutes and we made the connection by the skin of our teeth. Not a very relaxing way to start a vacation. On the return flights JMK-ATH was fine only taking 24 minutes. The flight from Athens was full 16 Business Class Passengers and again the service and the quality of the food really let Aegean Airlines down. The cabin crew on both International sectors were out of their depth service was slow and mean in quantity and quality. The return main meal was the worst we've ever had on an aircraft ever.,Aegean Airlines,,,

All flights on time very nice looking Airbus 320; good leather seats overhead TV screens and nice cabin crew.

Returned on Friday 24th August. We had booked a flight from Chania to Athens due to depart at 11.20. We eventually took off at 12.10 no explanation given. We were really worried as our connecting Aegean flight from Athens to Heathrow was leaving at 13.30! We landed in Athens at 13.15 and still did not know whether we would catch our flight as the stewardess said we could ask once we landed it did not lend itself to a smooth flight experience. However what happened next deserves a gold star: an Aegean representative met us as we came off the plane and escorted us very quickly and smoothly through several checks and security onto our London flight which took off as soon as we were on board at 1335. Amazing! And what is even more amazing is that our luggage was also found and secured onto our flight. Excellent recovery by Aegean.,Aegean Airlines,,3,

In flight service good - nice crew on both legs with lots of smiling and team spirit. Food ok but then we all have low expectations.

781,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,5,10,Aegean Airlines customer review,Stamatios Anthis (Belgium) 20th August 2012,unk,As always excellent service professional attitude for both the ground staff in Brussels as well as the people on board on the BRU-CFU flight on 17 August 2012. I am a frequent flyer with more than 30-35 flights per year. Aegean is the top of my preferences for both my professional trips as well as my vacation. This time I flew with my dog and staff on the ground have been extremely helpful in making my trip troubles free. The service on board is much better from the competition in the Belgium-Greece route. There is a good meal as well as free drinks throughout the flight. The airbus was clean and nicely decorated with enough leg space. In a few words: Aegean was an excellent choice.,Aegean Airlines,,,
782,,Economy Class,,,no,2,2,3,,2,4,Aegean Airlines customer review,Bob Delamare (United Kingdom) 20th August 2012,unk,We flew LHR-Athens return. Outbound on a fairly new aircraft was acceptable; about average for economy in terms of seat meal and entertainment. Return on a much older smaller plane was ghastly. Seats were tight together like budget airlines and service to match; not a serious national carrier. We were delayed 2 hours on the tarmac at Athens. That was beyond their control but they did nothing to alleviate the discomfort. Children crying cramped seats all taken. It is at times like this one sees the true quality. If all goes well as on the way out it's OK if not and you are on the older planes avoid!,Aegean Airlines,,3,
783,,Economy Class,,,no,3,2,1,,3,4,Aegean Airlines customer review,A Freeman (Greece) 19th August 2012,unk,I flew ATH to Corfu on full A320. Aegean are a world class airline as far as domestic flights are concerned but I was very disappointed with service on this flight. Due to Business Class being full 5 rows of economy didn't get served a refreshment at all on the flight. This is very poor cabin management. The crew were taking their time fully aware that they'd never get the service done. Even thought it's just a drink it left a very poor taste in my mouth from a PR perspective especially when they tried to blame bad weather.,Aegean Airlines,,4,
784,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,5,9,Aegean Airlines customer review,Rebecca Sachs (United States) 16th August 2012,unk,First time on Aegean for a family of 4 to go from Istanbul to Athens. Lines at airport moved fast no hassle on luggage flight left on time and arrived early seats were fairly comfortable and to our surprise we were offered a generous snack even though the flight was barely an hour duration. Overall superior in quality and service than any of the domestic flights we have taken in the US.,Aegean Airlines,,4,
785,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,5,8,Aegean Airlines customer review,Kym Streeter (France) 16th August 2012,unk,Paris-Athens-Mytilini. Compared to the competition this is the only option for Greece. Friendly service good hot food at lunch and evening flight with wine seat comfortable aircraft modern clean and on time. Overall very good.,Aegean Airlines,,3,
786,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,4,10,Aegean Airlines customer review,D Somarakis (Greece) 13th August 2012,unk,SKG to HER. Flight was on time! The plane an A320 Airbus was new and clean inside/out. Cabin crew was pleasant and caring the on board service was good even though the flight was just 1 hour. Seats were comfortable and you have the option to check in online! I have flown many times domestic and abroad and am always satisfied.,Aegean Airlines,,5,
787,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,5,9,Aegean Airlines customer review,Antonis Asprakis (United States) 6th August 2012,unk,ATH-FRA. Another great experience with Aegean on a clean and relatively new aircraft with a meal served by polite and caring crew. Although a moving map was displayed throughout the cabin a movie or some other form of entertainment would have been appreciated for this 3-hour flight (I flew Aegean to London before and a movie was shown). Regardless this airline is a pleasure to fly.,Aegean Airlines,,3,
788,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,4,10,Aegean Airlines customer review,C Smith (United Kingdom) 25th July 2012,unk,London Heathrow to Larnaca. Among the most attentive and pleasant crew I have come across. Clean and new airbus food service was very good. Drink service frequent - around 5 times for a 4.5 hr flight. Overall very welcoming and pleasant.,Aegean Airlines,,5,
789,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,3,,5,10,Aegean Airlines customer review,J Rudge (United Kingdom) 24th July 2012,unk,LCA-LHR on a nice clean A321. Aircraft left Larnaca on time cabin crew looked smart and were polite I had paid only £80 for my one way flight value for money was excellent as all drinks and food was included. Although cabin crew only came round I think 3 times on the 5 hour flight drinks were available on request if needed and cabin crew were happy to serve from the galley. In flight meal was average I find catering on all flights from Larnaca not that great! Seat was comfortable and I had plenty of leg room pilot kept us updated on arrival times and the weather back in the UK which is always nice to know you're going to land bang on time. Despite the bad weather in London landing was probably the smoothest I've ever had on a flight didn't know I had touched the ground! Just wish A3 didn't fly into Terminal 1 at LHR as its not that great and is rather run down other than that Aegean cannot be faulted. A great little airline and I will definitely fly with them again to Greece or Cyprus!,Aegean Airlines,,4,
790,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,4,,3,10,Aegean Airlines customer review,D Rat (Australia) 16th July 2012,unk,Flew Aegean to Santorini late June. Short and sweet flight. Cabin crew were professional and aircraft very clean. There was no food and inflight entertainment because of short flight nice gesture providing passengers with a light refreshment.,Aegean Airlines,,3,
791,,Business Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,5,10,Aegean Airlines customer review,M Tossounian (United Kingdom) 15th July 2012,unk,ATH - LHR sector on new Airbus A320. Very clean inside and out. Flight departed on time with pre-take off drinks in Business. Comfortable blue leather seats with the middle seat free allowing more room. Attractive and attentive crew service with a smile and very polite. Dinner was a choice from a menu which was plentiful and delicious with a good selection of Greek wines to accompany the meal. Headsets given out and a film shown during the flight. Regular water service throughout with pretzels and snacks. Excellent business product and would definitely use Aegean again.,Aegean Airlines,,4,
792,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,5,10,Aegean Airlines customer review,P Arnaud (France) 15th July 2012,unk,CDG to ATH. Great experience.

793,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,1,,3,7,Aegean Airlines customer review,Minas Sotirakopoulos (Greece) 15th July 2012,unk,I am a Gold member in both Greek airlines (Aegean-Olympic Air) traveling over 100 times a year and I have to admit that Aegean Air is highly recommended especially in Ground services (Lounges - Luggage priority services). They are excellent in the following services: Great Lounges with separate room for smokers. Good luggage priority service in Greece. They must improve the following: Offer free 24h parking just like Olympic Air offer for their Gold members. Improve their unacceptable prices and value for money for local flights. Dramatically improve their in flight food for local flights.,Aegean Airlines,,3,
794,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,5,10,Aegean Airlines customer review,Adrian Stavrakis (Greece) 13th July 2012,unk,Went from SKG to STR and after a week the other way around. My flights were A3510 and A3511. Excellent aircraft clean no malfunctioning seats inflight maps 2 captain announcements one the standard and one extra that we would experience some turbulence over Belgrade. Star-Alliance stylished meals served hot enough beverage and coffee happy to help flight attendants ultra-fast baggage drop-off and mobile check- in. I didn't even have to print my boarding pass. Highly recommended!,Aegean Airlines,,4,
795,,Economy Class,,,no,4,2,1,,3,5,Aegean Airlines customer review,R Thut (Switzerland) 13th July 2012,unk,I like to fly with A3 but the last flights (CFU-ATH-MUC) were the opposite. Since we were flying back home to ZRH we wanted to have all boarding cards. But for some reason we only got them until MUC. When I asked the lady at the check in she said Sorry I cannot help. You have to organise yourself in MUC. On both flights the flight attendants wanted to be somewhere else but on the flights. The food this time was inedible and the service awful. For a glass of water I had to ask 3 times and when she finally brought it she just rolled her eyes. I am not sure if I will fly with them again.,Aegean Airlines,,,
796,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,1,,,3,5,Aegean Airlines customer review,Z Rosen (Israel) 9th July 2012,unk,Charter service from Tel Aviv to Heraklion. A320 new and clean all leather seats. Only drinks served. All female crew seemed completely disinterested. Airshow available however no position of the aircraft available only the map of the area. Heard good things about A3 service however that was not the experience we had.,Aegean Airlines,,1,
797,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,3,4,,4,8,Aegean Airlines customer review,J Chen (Greece) 2nd July 2012,unk,Flew from Athens to Santorini in a new A321 aircraft. Economy seats were leather and soft and comfortable and the luggage bins were very large (I was able to fit my acoustic guitar in the cabin). The views as the flight took off and landed were incredible but the flight tickets were slightly expensive for such a short distance. Inflight entertainment was unfortunately absent as the flight (1hr) was too short for it and beverages were only served to half the passengers for the same reason. Otherwise it was a good trip.,Aegean Airlines,,3,
798,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,3,5,,1,5,Aegean Airlines customer review,Chris Tomko (United States) 2nd July 2012,unk,On 16-JUN my flight from Milan to Athens (connecting to Mykonos) which was suppose to leave at 21.10 left at 02.00. We were given little info other than plane broken and a new one coming from Athens. When the new plane arrived the ground staff and gate were disorganized making the delay even longer. During this extreme delay we were given snacks and water. Once arriving into Athens and missing my flight to JMK a ticket agent helped us and put us on a departure getting us in only a few hours late on Olympic. I emailed Aegean three times to enquire about a refund or another ticket (As we were instructed to do both in MXP and ATH) and it took two emails to get a response. Overall Aegean usually pretty good (I fly once or twice a year) but this interaction made me lose some trust.,Aegean Airlines,,1,
799,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,3,,5,10,Aegean Airlines customer review,A Shomer (Israel) 1st July 2012,unk,TLV-HER and back. It was a charter flight so I expected a bad experience but was pleasantly surprised. We left on time. The A320 was new and clean. The cabin crew were very helpful and nice. Very informative announcements by the captain. Good leg space.,Aegean Airlines,,3,
800,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,4,8,Aegean Airlines customer review,Pascal Languillon (New Zealand) 17th June 2012,unk,Paris to Corfu via Athens. All flights were on time aboard newish A320.

801,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,5,,5,9,Aegean Airlines customer review,A Vlasov (United Kingdom) 17th June 2012,unk,Athens to London in economy. The flight departed on time and arrived 10 mins early. Very tasty meal served on board much bigger than expected. Several rounds of drinks movies shown during flight. Very attentive cabin staff. Overall an excellent flight for just EUR70.,Aegean Airlines,,4,
802,,Economy Class,,,no,2,3,2,,4,5,Aegean Airlines customer review,P McCarthy (United Kingdom) 11th June 2012,unk,LHR-ATH return. Found Aegean to be very average. Flight out delayed by 2 hours due to high winds with gate attendants 'managing expectations' stringing the delay out by 10 minutes every 15 that went by; however the return was on time. A321's seats are closely bunched for leg room and lack any head rests making sleep tricky on the longish flight. Cabin service was just slow meals of dismal quality in both directions though wine pleasant. A film was shown in both directions which worked OK. Some crew were friendly others were not focused. Online check-in works well but won't from their own iphone app. Experience at both airports fine. I enjoyed the BA experience more on this route for the quality of the product onboard.,Aegean Airlines,,4,
803,,Economy Class,,,no,1,1,2,,1,1,Aegean Airlines customer review,Elizabeth Kanelli (United Kingdom) 7th June 2012,unk,I have never experienced such a horrible trip. I was surrounded by 3 children all under the age of 6 who were screaming and yelling through the entire flight. They had toys on the floor and swinging from the chairs in the hallway of the plane and I was stuck in my seat not even being able to use the bathroom. The stewardess did not do much to stop the yelling because it was beyond her. By the time my dinner reached me it was cold and tasteless - last but not least my earphones did not work so I could not hear the TV monitor and had to also pick up trash that was stuck between my seat. Never again.,Aegean Airlines,,1,
804,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,5,,5,9,Aegean Airlines customer review,Paul Legate (United Kingdom) 6th June 2012,unk,LHR-ATH. A good experience with Aegean the overnight flight was fairly busy but the crew were professional there were 2 drink runs and the meal was very good but the portions were small. A320 was clean and the leather seats were comfortable. Headsets were handed out there was a good music selection and a movie was shown on the overhead screens. Flight arrived into Athens a few minutes early and the luggage didn't take too long to appear. An extremely good service and would use them again without hesitation.,Aegean Airlines,,4,
805,,Economy Class,,,no,4,4,1,,2,4,Aegean Airlines customer review,A Pan (Greece) 30th May 2012,unk,ATH-LHR with A3. Unfortunately some items in the A3 package continue to deteriorate. I booked my flight 3 days prior to my trip. It was expensive and I thought that the flights would be full nevertheless the flight to LHR was at 65% and the return at 85%. Inflight catering its a joke. Frozen pasta and a very small salad. No water service on 3.5 hour flight. The crew are very efficient but there is no interaction all you see is frozen smiles. Baggage delivery takes a life in LHR and half a life in ATH. Both flights well ahead of time but what's the point if you wait 45 minutes for your luggage? Big problem is that BA has almost the same problems and there is no third alternative on ATH-LHR route.,Aegean Airlines,,4,
806,,Economy Class,,,no,2,1,1,,1,3,Aegean Airlines customer review,A Bunting (United Kingdom) 29th May 2012,unk,"Belfast to Larnaca 18th May at 23.40pm. The food was shocking and the staff rude and unhelpful. You were not allowed any drinks after the first round with your meals unless it was water. The toilet doors at the front were locked and out of order. One lady asked about her booked meal - the air hostess replied ""no booked meals tonight"" shrugged her shoulders and walked on. On the way home however Larnaca to Belfast it was like a different airline - air hostesses were well presented and couldn't do enough but the food was still shocking. On both flights - no film or inflight entertainment.",Aegean Airlines,,1,
807,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,5,5,,5,9,Aegean Airlines customer review,M Prawdzik (United Kingdom) 15th May 2012,unk,LHR-ATH-LHR. Clean new Airbus 320 aircraft. Seats not perfect but good legroom compensates this. A selection of nice music before take off helps you fall in the good travelling mode. Both flights ahead of schedule. I'm scared of flying so a smiling and helpful flight attendants attitude definitely helped. Sweets before take off a small but nice touch. Decent proper meal with honest wine that actually tasted good. Overall a very good airline which helped me begin my holidays few hours before reaching Greece and prolonged it for a few hours when I was leaving.,Aegean Airlines,,4,
808,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,5,9,Aegean Airlines customer review,J Middleton (United Kingdom) 13th May 2012,unk,Heathrow to Larnaca return. Aircraft A321 clean and tidy. Departed and arrived on time both ways. Good food inflight entertainment free drinks great service and friendly crew. Booked well in advance and got a great price. All in all a very good airline.,Aegean Airlines,,4,
809,,Economy Class,,,no,5,3,1,,4,8,Aegean Airlines customer review,A Douas (Greece) 8th May 2012,unk,ATH-LHR A321. Some things never change. Food inedible I knew this so I went onboard with a full stomach. I understand priority luggage should come first but not 10 minutes before everyone else's! I have noticed this on a couple of Aegean flights. Plane was new and clean as always cabin crew decent. Aegean if you want those extra stars you need better food better luggage handling services and more happy faces!,Aegean Airlines,,2,
810,,Economy Class,,,no,1,3,2,,4,2,Aegean Airlines customer review,L Garyfallos (Greece) 29th April 2012,unk,Heathrow-Athens. A huge line for baggage drop with only 2 Aegean employees to check-in the entire flight. A problem with the baggage belt added more waiting time and frustration. Staff were really snappy and rude. Due to that delay there was a 20 minute delay in boarding and departure. The plane was really hot (the air- conditioning did little to help). Finally when we arrived in Athens we had to wait an extra 20 minutes for bags to start coming out on the belt. Overall an unpleasant travel experience.,Aegean Airlines,,4,
811,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,2,,4,7,Aegean Airlines customer review,D MacDonald (United Kingdom) 24th April 2012,unk,Athens to Frankfurt. Nice lounge at Athens with good selection of food.

812,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,4,,5,9,Aegean Airlines customer review,Spyros Gatos (Greece) 23rd April 2012,unk,Thessaloniki-Samos return. Airbus A319 both ways. Flights full. Attentive crew nice flights drinks served for a 50 minutes flight. Recommended.,Aegean Airlines,,,
813,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,3,,4,7,Aegean Airlines customer review,I Poukis (Cyprus) 16th April 2012,unk,Staff at Heathrow Airport not very helpful. Manager quite ignorant to people's needs. Cabin crew quite the opposite very polite and always smiling. A shame how one can spoil it for the other. If you have excess luggage I personally think they over charge. They charge £15.00 per kilo and believe me you cannot get away with it.,Aegean Airlines,,3,
814,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,5,,5,9,Aegean Airlines customer review,Nick Biskinis (United Kingdom) 1st April 2012,unk,LHR-ATH return - A320 outbound A321 return. Excellent service and a good fare.

816,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,5,,5,8,Aegean Airlines customer review,A Magpantay (Philippines) 17th October 2011,unk,I loved flying Aegean Air from Rome to Athens in May 2011. Check in was a breeze. The food was warm and good even had dessert. Staff was courteous and helpful. After flying EasyJet for most parts of my 2 week European backpacking trip flying Aegean was a treat.,Aegean Airlines,,3,
817,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,5,9,Aegean Airlines customer review,M Heather (United Kingdom) 16th October 2011,unk,LHR - Mykonos rtn via Athens both ways. 30 minute delay outbound from LHR meant connection was very tight in Athens. Cabin crew provided reassurance to anxious passengers (one crew member saying 'Aegean Airlines cares for its passengers don't worry) and at Athens those of us with tight connections were met by a lady who competently and at very high speed escorted us through what is a complex connecting arrangement. No delays on the return service and we landed 15 minutes early at LHR. Service onboard was good with a hot meal and a free bar. On the way from LHR to ATH we had a new A321 aircraft with in flight entertainment (main screen). Otherwise flights were on a mix of A319 and A320 of varying ages. Thoroughly enjoyed my flights with them the crew work hard and seem proud of their airline.,Aegean Airlines,,4,
818,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,3,10,Aegean Airlines customer review,Mike Lambert (Germany) 16th October 2011,unk,Heathrow to Larnaca return in October 2011. Excellent in every respect - new clean aircraft relaxed and attentive service.,Aegean Airlines,,3,

820,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aegean Airlines customer review,R Chalmers (United Kingdom) 14th October 2011,unk,Athens-Chios-Athens Economy. Despite this being only a 20 minute flight it's operated by an A320. Very few passengers on it on outward leg but quite busy on return with large number of pax transiting Athens en route to US and Canada having been back home for summer. Service was okay - early morning flight so we were offered coffee/ soft drink and chocolate croissant. Check in at Athens was very efficient. Chios is the smallest airport I have experienced but everything went very smoothly - even in a very cramped check in area there was no long delay getting luggage checked in and boarding cards issued.,Aegean Airlines,,,
821,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aegean Airlines customer review,P Demosthenous (Cyprus) 13th October 2011,unk,Staff excellent customer service oriented meals are good and the planes are new. The seats are comfortable and lounge in Athens has a smoking area that is not packed.,Aegean Airlines,,,
822,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,1,6,Aegean Airlines customer review,Lee Melbourn (United Kingdom) 25th September 2011,unk,I flew 4 flights with them over the summer and everyone of them was delayed. I am aware there are air traffic control restrictions so may not be the airlines fault. However I feel they are crafty as we were just getting up to a 3 hour delay when they boarded us only to sit on the plane for ages so they would not have to pay any compensation. On the plus side the fleet is modern and new. On all but one of the flights the cabin crew were helpful smart and smiling. I found the food to be adequate although no choice. You can check in online 48 hours before the flight and also book emergency row seats for no extra charge.,Aegean Airlines,,,
823,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aegean Airlines customer review,I Giannakis (Greece) 17th September 2011,unk,I have often flown Aegean and I always look forward to. Nice service only bad thing - occasionally you book with Aegean and end up having a return flight or a second leg with an inferior company. Make sure you check what connections and return flights are involved.,Aegean Airlines,,,

825,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aegean Airlines customer review,G White (United Kingdom) 12th September 2011,unk,LHR-ATH-JMK. Bags were transferred seamlessly at Athens which was my main concern. LHR-ATH flight was smooth cabin lighting could have been dimmed with one meal/trolley service for the flight food was served quickly however and the cabin crew were extremely friendly. ATH-JMK was the quickest flight I've ever done and by the time they handed out the drinks they were grabbing them back for landing. Overall a pleasant flying experience helped by the open selection on booking seats (I got exit rows) and the ability to check in 48 hrs before. My one criticism is when doing cabin announcements they speak English so quickly that you do not always hear/understand what is being said.,Aegean Airlines,,,
826,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,7,Aegean Airlines customer review,Nigel Chism (United Kingdom) 1st September 2011,unk,LHR-ATH-CFU return. Good planes seats and food. All on time. Let down only by the crew who though very glamorous were a bit clueless. On both long legs I attempted to get a second drink - all met with nods and smiles - to no avail. The Business lounge in Athens was good.,Aegean Airlines,,,
827,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aegean Airlines customer review,M Kyriakides (United Kingdom) 31st August 2011,unk,LHR-LCA return in Economy. Cabin crew were attentive and professional.

830,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aegean Airlines customer review,Konstantinos Tsolos (Greece) 4th August 2011,unk,Athens - Heathrow route. Arrived at terminal 1 30mins late due to air traffic. Had another 2.5 hrs to collect baggage and check in at terminal 5 for a domestic flight on BA. A fast walk to the baggage claim took about 20mins and thereafter waited another 30mins for the baggage to arrive. By the time someone accepted us at one of the many empty counters it was already too late. We missed our connection I strongly recommend allowing at least 4 hrs to connect from terminal 1 to 5. The airline itself is very good. Clean and new A321 friendly flight crew and free drinks onboard meal was average.,Aegean Airlines,,,
831,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aegean Airlines customer review,J Dionisiou (Greece) 2nd August 2011,unk,I fly around 10 times each year to domestic and European destinations Aegean is my preferred airline for many years now I never had a problem except once where there was a delay of 1hr but they issued a free ticket for me and my wife so I can't complain. Aircraft's always clean stuff friendly and kind. They are a top airline with very good service.,Aegean Airlines,,,
832,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aegean Airlines customer review,Z Evans (Australia) 6th July 2011,unk,ATH-SKG ATH-AXD ATH-JMK. Aegean was quite good: flight attendants were nice food was OK the pilot was good when he explained to us that we would be delayed. The only problem was there wasn't enough room for my bag on the plane so somehow it ended up in security and it took 1/2 hr to find it!,Aegean Airlines,,,
833,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aegean Airlines customer review,J Kramer (Germany) 30th June 2011,unk,SKG-STR A320. Everything worked well despite air traffic control strikes in Greece. It was anyway one of the best medium-haul flights. Online-Check-In efficient baggage-drop-off at the counter - no queues. We had to leave Thessalonika before 6pm because of the strikes. Plane arrived late so they really did a good job to turn the plane around in 20 mins. Cabin clean proper looking. Comfortable seating. Great service with a warm meal and a wide choice of beverages. Staff unbelievably friendly and helpful. Arrived on time. Great!,Aegean Airlines,,,
834,,Business Class,,,yes,,,,,4,5,Aegean Airlines customer review,M Ogden (Australia) 26th June 2011,unk,Paris CDG-Athens. Arrived early at the checkin counter to be told to go away as I was 30 mins early when we did check in there was a queue and things were really slow due to being a terminal. Then because we had excess baggage (which took 20 mins to determine) we had to pay at another counter...20 mins to do that!!!! Then back to checkin counter for another 30 mins delay. All in all after arriving 2.8 hrs before flight departure we got to the departure gate 20 mins before boarding. A complete and utter shambles. Flight though was excellent! Cabin crew were attentive meal good and aircraft/cabin condition clean and modern.,Aegean Airlines,,,
835,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aegean Airlines customer review,Jonathan Hui (Hong Kong) 8th June 2011,unk,ATH-LHR on A321. Toys were given out to kids before take off. Many passengers had ordered special diets but FA managed to deliver our meals as quick as possible. Always ask if you need a second bread. Hot meal with one choice (beef brisket with rice) and I am amazed how they prepare such a Hong Kong style cuisine!

They did not deliberately increase their prices during the mad panic caused by the bad weather in Europe in the days before Christmas. My original booking to travel London to Athens was with KLM and then I was passed to Air France. Neither of them could organize things properly and after endless problems it took them 4 days to get me only as far as Paris with no hope of leaving for at least a day. Aegean came to my rescue and even though they also took off late they made sure I did not miss my next flight with them to a Greek island. During this 4 day nightmare I had to rebook my domestic flight several times with Aegean and they were very accommodating.,Aegean Airlines,,,

My only minor complaints would be at Heathrow they have just 3 or so desks and only open these a couple of hours or so before departure so you have to queue up to check the bags in - web check in is not that straightforward - I was unable to check us all in together but had to do it as 4 separate check ins.

Some of the flight attendants have the nasty habit of ignoring passengers and thereby forgetting to bring drinks or meals to some.

In general I would say that it is a very good company as long as everything goes well and you DONT need anything from the customer support. In that case you have to wait for hours (sometimes days) for someone to pick up the phone quite often to tell you that she/he is not competent to respond to your question and as such your call will be forwarded. Surprisingly 9 out of 10 times nobody will pick up the forwarded call. Another malicious trick they are doing is saying that you should wait for the responsible person to call you. Something that may happen after a week or so if you get lucky. They also have the bad habit of not informing the passengers for delays or other unexpected event that may jeopardise the trip. I missed a flight once (one of the very few that departed that day) because the advice of the Athens airport information desk (Aegean did not pick up the phone or the line was busy from 9 in the morning till midnight) to to my question if the flight will be delayed-cancelled or not was to go at the airport four o'clock in the morning and hope that the flight will take place otherwise ask the Aegean people there. I didn't risk it. As a result I was waiting 4 months to get the taxes from the ticket back. There are also hidden charges as using the internet to book tickets involves a fee the same applies though if you book the tickets by phone.,Aegean Airlines,,,

The service was nice the crew was friendly but when I asked for a newspaper the flight attendant took a note of my seat; but she never brought me the newspaper (may be they run out of newspapers because they had lot of people in business class). In the returned flight the flight attendant noticed my seat and then she brought the newspaper to me.

I have now flown over 59 airlines in total from 5 star airlines to 2 stars and over a hundred airports around the world from a small airport in Dunedin in New Zealand to the likes of Heathrow and Changi in Singapore, but the attitude of the check-in agent for Aer Lingus at BHD is something that I haven’t encountered anywhere. I’m also a BA Silver Executive Club member (nearly gold now). To say it was rude was an understatement. She treated us like we haven’t flown before. My mate and I were trying to explain that at BHX, they’d let us combine our check-in baggage, but this woman won’t let us and she was argumentative.

Aer Lingus customer service at the airport was going to rebook us and pay for the new flights but couldn't find any flights for 2 days. The service rep at the airport recommended we book our own flights if we could find any and send in for compensation so that's what we did. She implied we should get some kind of compensation for the flight, hotels and other expenses. We had to stay the night in Heathrow and booked our own flights out the next day. When we submitted everything for compensation they denied everything. I tried 3 times to get them to cover at least a portion of our expenses but they did nothing. also, you cannot talk to customer service, everything is thru email. I have had several flight disruptions over the years and have never had an airline not compensate us for something. This was the worse flight disruption I've ever experienced and cost us over $10,000 to get back home. Aer Lingus kept throwing some flight regulations at us on why they don't have to",Aer Lingus,,,

My bag had suffered damage at Heathrow a few day earlier and the agent at Cork Airport was very informative and supportive and told me how to make a complaint. Boarding was orderly and efficient and the cabin crew on this short flight of just under one hour were not only professional but very good representatives of their airline and indeed country. I saw several people with children and an elderly gentleman being assisted unprompted by the cabin crew. Disembarkation was quick and the luggage arrived promptly too.

I had to leave home very early for the check-in as this flight departed at 640am. The queue for check-in and bag drop off was very poorly managed from a range of perspectives and created a very poor first impression of the airline. Firstly, there was a visible disagreement between 2 uniformed staff members. A member of staff was unable to use a computer and had to call one of her colleagues for help. This employee was not only unable to use the computer but was unnecessarily abrupt with customers and contradicted herself in the instructions she barked out. She could see one of the bag-drop machines was broken and sent 2 young people and an elderly couple to the machine in question and then ignorantly shouted at the elderly couple when they told her for the second time that the machine was broken. When I used a self-drop off machine, I was rudely spoken to by a man. Passengers ended up helping each other as the staff were of no help. Boarding was functional but not well organised. On this busy flight the staff were almost invisible. When the aircraft arrived into Dublin there was a delay as another aircraft was at the gate. The positive side is that the flight was punctual.

No big deal, we thought. Usually airlines would route us to the final destination without much fuss. Not the case with aer Lingus. Aer Lingus doesn’t have relationship with most major airlines. So you are presented with very limited choices. Our best case alternative routing presented was over 12 hours of delay from the original time. We even asked for a direct connection the next day but they didn’t have flights to Zürich on Sunday. So the next flight was two days away. We took the alternate route they provided. We were not provided any compensation or voucher.  We had to take the checked bags out at Ireland and go through immigration to get the rebooking done and had to check in afresh again. They provided boarding passes only until Amsterdam and not to the final destination Zürich. The baggage tag was also to Amsterdam. I raised concern over that. The agent said we should collect our bags again at Amsterdam and recheck and collect boarding passes at Amsterdam at KLM counter. The flight to Amsterdam was delayed by two hours. When we reached Amsterdam, we had to go through immigration and collect the bags again. We did that and when we went to check in the bags, we were told that their system doesn’t show that we paid for the bags and we have to pay again. We paid for 30 kg check in bags. Due to Aer Lingus's fault, we now have to pay again for the baggage (55 euro) and an excess baggage fee of 75 euro. Not only that, we had to visit six different counters to get this issue resolved. We spent well over four hours going from counter to counter with kids and bags. Klm staff asked us to pay them and seek reimbursement from aer lingus. When we contacted aer Lingus via them WhatsApp business account, they asked to register a case at their website and provided a link. After filling out all the details meticulously, the form crashes with a server error. Wow. Please don’t ruin your trip / vacation flying Aer Lingus.",Aer Lingus,,3,3

We happened to be celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary and booked a trip to Italy. The flight itself was fine. We arrived at the airport in Naples and were the only passengers on a flight of 300+ people to be standing at the baggage carousel when it shut down because all the bags had been picked up by the passengers except for us. Our bags were missing. So now we head over to the missing baggage window and fill out a missing baggage claim form. This is Sunday morning. We make our way to the hotel with the clothes on our back for a week long stay to celebrate our anniversary not sure where our luggage is. We are tired. We have been on two flights for 10 hours. We wake up the next morning and put on the same clothes we arrived in to get breakfast. Never mind that there are new outfits in our luggage that we purchased for this trip that are floating around somewhere. After calling Aer Lingus multiple times and being told our luggage is out for delivery, we logged on to their missing baggage website only to learn our luggage has not been located yet in spite of Aer Lingus agents lying and telling us on the phone our bags were on the way. Was this so we wouldn’t go out and purchase necessary items to change into to keep Aer Lingus lost baggage costs lower. We are now in our 3rd full day in Italy and Aer Lingus still stands by their claim that one bag is out for delivery, when the truth of the matter is they can’t specify where it is en route. This saga will probably continue for us long after we depart Italy in two days. To add insult to injury, Aer Lingus cannot tell us what is acceptable and necessary that we can purchase while we wait hopelessly for our luggage. Talk about being given the run around, reading from a computer screen that the bags are in route, escalating our calls to supervisors who only read the same script on a screen. My Advice to Everyone out there - DO NOT BOOK YOUR FLIGHT through Aer Lingus if you value the peace of mind that you are entrusting a company that values it’s customers and will make a sincere effort to correct an error in a timely and honest manner. Let’s face it, a lot of people are like us, we don’t travel all the time, we spent thousands of hard earned dollars, and to be in Europe for going on four days in the same skivvies we arrived in should not be tolerated by customers - so book with another airlines if you value peace of mind.",Aer Lingus,A330,1,1

I can accept many things, especially because of covid. Airline flights cancelled, lack of full staff, the list goes on. So, for this summer expect a whole lot of cancelled flights. So lets look at what a cancelled flight looks like in this post covid era. First off you'll get a message that your flight is delayed. Ok, so we'll just hang out in the club lounge a little longer, have a bite to eat, a beverage and just relax. Maybe an hour later check on how the flight is going and oh my! The gate looks like a scene at a border crossing: Its humid, its hot, there are people laying on the ground, babies are crying. Real hell on earth...well back to club for me! Then 3 hours after our plane should have left they announce flight cancelled. I go the gate and again see a scene of human misery, that's passengers I'm talking about, not Aer Lingus employees, they've booked it for the exits and gone home (probably high-fiving each other with, 'great job today!'). So we are left to our own devices and somehow all wonder to check-in like zombies out of a horror film (and the babies are still crying). An hour passes (it's now 10pm and we have been at the airport since 3pm) and word filters down that our luggage is in baggage claim. Off we all go to pick up our luggage (picture zombies trudging with a suitcase (and I wonder how those zombies with babies picked up their luggage?) Again we are at check-in with no Aer Lingus staff. Finally at 11pm someone who is not Aer Lingus starts to sort through this misery and give us direction, hotel, call this number, etc. And now for the zinger, not once, not at any time did any Aer Lingus staff show any humanity for the 3 or 6 month old babies that were crying.

However when I got to Dublin Aer Lingus had a system failure so all their EU flights were canceled but they were still pushing out the flights to the US. My flight got delayed 3 times however we finally boarded but about 30-40 minutes after boarding and right when the air hostess were giving the safety instructions they got a call from the pilot and couple minutes later the Pilot announced that the flight couldn't take off because he would go over the amount of flying time he can legally complete. When the flight was canceled it was around 11 pm and they promised to give us a hotel and reimburse us for finding new flights. They did not find us new flights we had to find them ourselves and they didn't provide us with accommodations. I ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport over night and spent at least 30 hours in the airport because of this whole ordeal. To this day I still haven't received the refund or the reimbursement for finding a new flight and it is now 2.5 months later. I understand that they would have been understaffed and thrown off guard when the system crashed but no staff member that I talked to seemed like they wanted to help.

The airline was a step above a budget airline. Here's what was average the seats, the onboard service, and the entertainment options. The airline meals were tiny and hardly filled you up. The wifi did not work on any of our flights. However, it was upon arriving in Dublin that our problems began. We had a three hour delay due to ""weather"" despite the fact that the sun was shining and there was almost zero snow or ice on the ground. It took hours for them to de-ice the plane which is the airlines responsibility. The ground crew never told any of the passengers what was happening or how long we could expect to be delayed. The zero communication was very frustrating. The short flight to London had no complementary beverages of any sort despite the long delay. On our return flight to the U.S., in the Gatwick airport there was a single gate agent checking in 80+ passengers. We stood in line for almost an hour. Why Aer Lingus? We almost missed our flight despite arriving to the airport two hours early. The airline's apps and online website never worked and we were unable to check in before we arrived to the airport which meant we were confined to the very last row on the plane.

To start, when we arrived to check in (2 hours before boarding) there was already an announcement stating the flight was delayed by 1 hr. Once boarded we sat for an additional HOUR on the tarmac, causing us to miss our connecting flight home (amazingly the only flight of theirs that left only 15 minutes late). They re-routed us to Seattle, which meant an addition 2.5 hour layover before boarding the connecting flight. There was no offer of food or beverages even though we were missing our in-flight meal service. Once we boarded the connecting flight we AGAIN sat for 1 hour and 45 minutes in the tarmac. No offer of snacks or food. Mind you we are about 4 hours past when we should of had out meal service so we were starving. Thank god our last flight from Seattle to San Fran was with Alaska Airlines as they were great. So to sum things up, we were originally to be home at 3:30 pm on 9/2 but we didn’t arrive until 9/3 at 12 am and of course our baggage was still in Dublin, adding an additional 30 minutes in the airport to submit a claim for the lost bags.

During the flight the crew served “to buy” drinks and then duty free items.

Several bag drop machines did not work and so I assisted several elderly people including an non-English speaking couple to use the machines. This was not good enough to state the obvious. I shall add that boarding was not well managed with certain passengers allowed to carry far too much luggage onto the flight. The aircraft was modern with inflight entertainment but the seats were thin and uncomfortable. There was a delay taking off and very poor communication from the crew on a very full flight. Once the flight arrived in Dublin there was no gate available for over 30 minutes the captain did not communicate this well and several Americans were worried about not making their flight on time. Disembarkation was like a rugby scrum. The luggage took a rather long time to come through in Dublin and there was little help at hand for passengers and only a few machines on which to log a complaint!

The Aer Lingus website didn't recognise our BA booking reference, so no information could be obtained there either.

It took 30 mins on the phone to Aer Lingus to establish that our baggage allowance had only been reduced to 20 kgs. BA and Aer Lingus should have a better interface, as they are both part of the IAG group and sell each other's tickets.

The lady at the check in desk at Aer Lingus said she could only give us the boarding pass for the flight on Aer Lingus from Glasgow to Dublin. All of our flights were booked through United, United is the one that put us on Aer Lingus. She said she could not issue our boarding passes for the connecting flights from Dublin to Chicago and Chicago to LA. She told us we would have to go through the ""transfer center"" in Dublin. When we got to Dublin, there was an area for people to scan their boarding passes and continue on. We only had our passes from Glasgow to Dublin, so when we scanned the pass in Dublin, it rejected it and would not let us pass through. The people working there (Dublin airport employees) told us we would have to go through customs, downstairs and go to United check in desk, When we got through Irish customs and to the United desk, the lady said our flight was closed. She worked on her computer to get us on and we were given our boarding passes for Dublin to Chicago, and Chicago to LA. Her co-worker told us we might not make it to the gate on time. But then we had to clear Irish customs and security again, and then we had to go to USA pre clearance- security and customs again with long lines for all of these. I was very upset and anxious the longer it took, it seemed like one line or queue after another. I was picked out for advanced screening which took even more extra time. Our layover in Dublin was only 2 hours and we almost missed our flight. We were finally cleared and ended up running across Dublin airport to our gate.

I called to request a bassinet seat for my baby to be able to sleep on the 7 hour flight from Chicago to Dublin (8 hours on the way back), and I was told to contact Special Assistance through their website, which I did. I was then told via email that I was assigned row 30 on flight EI122, and was told this was a bassinet row. When I boarded the plane (which was two hours delayed), I arrived at my seat, baby in my arms, to discover that row 30 is a bulkhead row but nota bassinet row. The only bassinet row on the aircraft I was on is row 9. The flight attendants told me not much could be done, but finally we begged to switch with someone in row 9 and someone was kind enough to do it. However, I had to move back before landing so that the original passenger in row 9 could alight the plane first, so had to lug myself, my infant son, and all our stuff back and forth three separate times.  While onboard my flight to Chicago, I discovered eventually that my seat's media system was broken, the remote for it did not work, so that even though the screen seemed to be fine, I could not control anything/make anything play on it. This meant I could not watch anything, could not listen to anything, could not even call the flight attendant, turn on my own light. When I was finally able to alert a flight attendant and let them know, they brushed me off and said they would make a note of it, offering nothing else to help or compensate. I had no media available to me after I was able to get my baby to sleep in the bassinet they provided, which, by the way, is a beat up cardboard box lined with airline pillows, and airline blanket, and strapped in with straps that go above the baby's feet and right above the baby's head. Far from a nice set up. On the day before my original flight back from Dublin to Chicago, I tested positive for Covid 19. While I've been asymptomatic, I understand that the US requires negative tests to re-enter the country, and while it was an unfortunate situation, I anticipated being able to handle it. I did not  anticipate that Aer Lingus would have no policy for dealing with this kind of a situation. I once again waited on hold with them for over an hour to be told that in a situation like this, all they can offer is for you to change your flight for a large sum of money (over 450 euro in my case). They offer no flexibility which is impossible for a situation like this one. I can't imagine I am the only one (I'm probably one of hundreds if not thousands) who is having to reschedule their flight because they will not be let into the country due to unexpected test results. But Aer Lingus offer no sort of flight credit or flexibility, even though I have no way of knowing when I will test negative and be let back into the US. It could be in two days time, it could be in twenty days time, and Aer Lingus only seeks to make you change your flight over and over again, charging you more and more money each time, even though this is something completely out of the passenger's control. I finally booked a flight seven days away, and just hoped and prayed I would be negative by then, also knowing I would miss a good amount of work and income by being out of the country",Aer Lingus,A330,1,1

This I did 2 days pre-flight. When I arrived at the airport at 8:00AM, the Aer Lingus check in staff queried my COVID certificate, but I told her that my final destination was Canada, not US, and I was told that my COVID certificate was then ""fine"". My baggage was checked in, I got through security, US customs and border protection, and all the way I proceeded to the boarding gate. When I approached the boarding gate staff at 10:40AM, I was asked to fill out a form for US clearance stating that I had a negative test within the last 24 hours. I couldn’t sign this and told the ground attendant that my final destination was Canada. He told me to wait aside. After all the other passengers have been boarded, he told me that I could not board the flight to New York since I didn’t have a negative test taken within the previous 24 hours. At that stage, it was then too late for me to get an antigen test. The other ground attendant told me the luggage would be off-loaded and I will have to collect them in carousel 6. He tried to rebook my flight, but since I had booked with Trip.com, he said I should contact the travel agency as he couldn’t change it. I was escorted to the exit leading to baggage reclaim and told “You know if you hadn’t said anything, we would have never noticed it. That’s what you get for being so honest.” I contacted Trip.com and the rep said she will forward an urgent flight change request to Aer Lingus. I then got an email stating “the airline said that according to the policy they cannot operate the change. Your ticket is non-changeable after departure, it is all up to the airline company.” At that stage, my options being extremely limited, I rebooked my flights to Calgary at a cost of 644 euro plus I had to get another PCR test for 69 euro. I managed to fly next day but to add insult to injury, all the luggage that I paid for went missing and did not arrive with me.  If I had been told at check-in on my original flight that my COVID cert was invalid for the US, and if my luggage had not been checked through, I would have had time to get a negative antigen test, I wouldn’t have been denied boarding and wouldn’t have incurred the extra expense (644 euro flight + 69 euro PCT test).  I have written to Aer Lingus and they initially ""offered"" to refund the flight. However, that also seemed to be the end of the conversation from them. I submitted multiple follow-up requests using their case update portal but haven't received a single response since then. Trip.com will refund me but they cannot proceed as Aer Lingus has not refunded them yet. What happened to me was an avoidable mistake by the ground attendants at the airport.

We were told that the airport would then be closed, but we might be able to get a cab to a nearby hotel, but they were not sure if any were running. Their plan was to dump us outside of Boston Airport at 1 or 2 in the morning. Remember, this is after 2 extremely turbulent attempted landings and a diversion to a different airport. I asked if they could put us up in the Hartford Airport hotel instead. I was told yes and that I would be reimbursed, but the fastest way was to pay it myself and ask for reimbursement later. I also asked about having to rebook my connecting flight that was missed, and was told yes, it would be reimbursed. I was lucky enough to have enough to pay for an unexpected hotel and extra flight, but not everyone may have been so lucky. I filed a request for a reimbursement through Aer Lingus website as told to do. It took over a month for a response and was told that they could not help me because I showed them bank statements and no the original receipts. I got the original receipts and sent them in. I was denied at that point because ""there responsibility was to get me to Boston, not to pay for connecting flights or hotels.""

The advisor told me even though I couldn't get a refund as the flight hadn't officially been cancelled, that he could move the flights to the same dates next year due to ""exceptional circumstances"" free of charge. He then advised me to wait until 24 hours before my flight to do this as there was a chance I could get my money back in the event that the flight was cancelled. This was not the case however and when I rang to get the dates changed I was told by another advisor that there would be an additional charge of £168.00 on top of the £150.00 I had already paid. When I disputed this and told him about the previous conversation he became quite blunt and rude and told me to wait until 2 hours before my 7am flight to see if they were going to cancel it if I wanted my refund? Not usually one to write reviews at all, but I have never been so appalled or angry in my entire life, I think in the middle of a global pandemic, where people are struggling enough as it is, for an airline to blatantly rob people is beyond a joke! Basically, the fact that there's a lockdown means nothing when it comes to travelling, even though some people can not afford to take a further 2 weeks isolation period off work. I have handed Aer Lingus £150.00 of my money for nothing and have been refused a refund even due to the circumstances or even the basic courtesy of a flight change 1 year in advance.

The first flight out was on 12th  march and the upgrade bid was accepted and paid for. Unfortunately within a few days of travel the holiday was cancelled and we were advised to return home. Aer Lingus offered free change of flight but price difference would apply. The change function on the website and app were not working. I received a message telling me to contact direct by phone. I was surprised by this in such an age of automation, and a little disappointed. But I was given no other option by Aer Lingus. I called as advised and was on hold for a full 2 hours, I then spoke to an agent who advised my change of flights would be €435 as this represented the fare difference. I accepted and was asked to wait so he could set up payment, then he hung up without taking payment. I was not called or contacted by this agent despite him confirming my phone and email details. So I called again, and again on hold, this went on for 90 minutes when again, having not spoken to an agent, the line was hung up. I called again and after 1 hour the same occurred. That now made it close to 5 hours and no change of flights possible, the frustration at this lack of basic functionality in such a company I found staggering. With the global situation going from bad to worse and the fear of being trapped in the states with no medical insurance and all the other problems a lock down or illness would bring, we had no choice but to book completely different flights to get us home. Again we went with Aer Lingus and this cost us €1577.76. Although I was glad I could get us home, and in the knowledge that I did not have to use Aer Lingus again, despite being so frustrated at the lack of service, I did. But would have been a lot happier if the same ease to book new flights could have been matched by the process for changing existing flights. I received a mail 18th of March to say that I could cancel my flights for the 23rd and would receive a credit in the way of a flight credit plus 10%, again I would have preferred a refund but, was happy to cancel the flight and take the credit to be used later. Then I received a mail to say that my upgrade for my cancelled flight home had been approved and a further €980 had been debited to my card. I now make that a total of €2,5557.76 that I have paid Aer Lingus for flights I should have been able to change for €435. A staggering €2,122.76 cost difference because Aer lingus could not provide basic functionality to change a flight during an emergency. since then I have sent a number of emails looking for clarification and have been replied to by different people each time. the latest tells me that no vouchers apply for flights before the 21st of March. my flight was on the 23rd and I have provided all the documentation they have asked for on this.  In my latest call to them, after a further long wait, I was told that this would have to be dealt with by a manager and I was promised a call within 48 hours, this has not happened.

No staff to assist. By the time slow baggage was received the bus left . We were directed to the swissport counter and were given a taxi voucher to Amsterdam for the 2 hour drive. When I asked where the aer lingus staff were who were promised to assist they laughed and said there is no staff they just say that. Weather happens. You can give timely gate announcements and rebooking without an attitude that it is the passenger's fault. You cannot assume every passenger is lying about baggage and then have an attitude when wrong.  I believe this will be the last experience with this airline.,Aer Lingus,A320,,

Pleasant experience. Checkin was seamless and well organised and as we were a group of 20 they took our bags free-of-charge which made travelling through the airport an easier experience. However, boarding was quite a long drawn out process. Long walk, then lift/stairs to an eventual bus. Checkin is through Terminal 2 but you end up getting bused to a mini satellite terminal (South gates) where gate 335 is located before actually boarding the plane from the tarmac. Infrastructurally, this issue lies with DUB airport as opposed to AL itself. Onboard the staff were very friendly, courteous and operated efficiently. The first 45 minutes of the flight including takeoff were quite shaky and turbulent but cockpit provided plenty of info en route. Very nice flight, staff exellent but disembarking took some time as all passengers had to get off via front of the aircraft even when stairs were provided at the rear. Overall, I’d recommend Aer Lingus but a little more attention to the details: boarding and disembarking required.",Aer Lingus,A320,,

I had to take an emergency flight back to the states because my father passed away suddenly. I searched on skyscanner and Aer Lingus was the cheapest so I booked it. I am a disabled passenger so requested wheelchair service, as I cant walk or stand for very long. I did not however receive a wheelchair at any point of the journey. And I wasn't pointed in the right direction to get one.  I flew out of London city which is a small airport so I was able to make it through security and to the gate. When I got to Dublin I waited for everyone to leave from the plane before I did, as it's easier and less of a pain standing and waiting behind people. There was quite a long walk to get down the plane steps and into the baggage area to then find my way to my connecting flight. I noticed on the baggage belt there was a suitcase similar to mine, it was in fact my suitcase! They were supposed to have transferred it onto my next flight to Philadelphia. Luckily I had seen this because who knows if it would have made it there. Anyway after trying to find someone to take my luggage I noticed a desk and I explained the situation and said they'd personally make sure it made it onto my next flight Between my connecting flight I had to go through security again, which annoyed me. At security I hadn't put the tray on the belt straight so staff called me back to do it. It was very condescending, when she could have easily done it herself. Once on the plane, it was very spacious as I was lucky enough to have both seats next to me empty, which made the trip very pleasant. My flight home was easier than the trip I had there. I would like to warn people not to purchase the wifi. I have never had an issue purchasing wifi on a flight before but to spend £6/€6 on what I thought would last longer than a couple minutes, I think is disgusting (They confirmed it lasted 4.4mins) I have disputed this and they refuse to refund or do anything about my complaint. Also they ran out of the choice of food on the plane, con of sitting towards the back end of the plane I suppose, but I don't think this should happen. Landing in dublin, it was early hours of the morning I again struggled to get to my next gate.

Afterwards, I checked reviews online and began getting worried as the common theme seemed to be that staff was horrible, planes were cramped, and they lose luggage often. With those images in my head I went to the airport in Amsterdam hoping for the best but expecting the worst. The staff at the counter was pleasant and although there are no boarding groups everyone got on the plane free from incident. The plane wasn't any more cramped than other budget airlines. After US preclearance in Dublin, I boarded a larger plane from there to San Francisco. The plane was about half full which gave us our pick of open seats and the flight attendants were surprisingly pleasant. In fact, one gave me an extra meal saying I ""looked like a growing lad"". Unfortunately, the food was terrible. I only had carry on baggage which was not scrutinized for its size.

At the counter in Frankfurt I and about 20 other passengers were told by Aer Lingus staff that they would not check us in because Aer Lingus flights that day from Dublin into the US were cancelled. They did not give an explanation as to why although later I was told that it was 'operational problems'. We were sent to a separate desk with generic airport booking employees unrelated to Aer Lingus for rebooking. These airport people had to call the regular Aer Lingus hotlines in order to be able to rebook anyone, but these hotlines were busy for more than an hour, and the Aer Lingus people in those call center were only allowed to process 3 rebookings in a single call, drawing this whole process out unnecessarily. During this time the flight to Dublin had departed and the original Aer Lingus front desk people had disappeared. It took 3 hours until my rebooking was looked into, at which time most alternative transatlantic flight options for that day were gone. So were all the options with any of their partner airlines with which they allow free rebookings (of which there are few in the first place). So I was told to take a hotel and wait for a flight the next day.  I instead had to book a flight for the same day via British Airways via London on my own and had to pay over 2000EUR for that. Most of that money I now have as a loss, but at least according to EU regulation Aer Lingus owes me a compensation of 600EUR which would at least pay for a part of it. In phone calls and mail communication they have now started to claim that the flight had not been cancelled it had only been delayed and they don't owe me compensation. I checked the flight history on Flightaware and saw that EI0139 on 1/7 did indeed fly. The reason for this mess up I can't fathom. In any way, since they barred me from the flight, they owe me 600EUR regardless if the flight in the end would have been possible or not. While I'll eventually get the 600EUR, the time and money wasted so far both with the situation during the trip and dealing with them in the aftermath is enormous. And greatest is the disappointment with Aer Lingus. I have flow with them a couple of times and from those experiences had thought them to be a half way solid airline.

This was a big inconvenience for me since the meeting I attended was 4 days long. I had to buy 6 extra outfits on top of toiletries. The luggage arrived at the airport 2 days later. At that time I was already in Gainesville, GA. The delivery company had called me while I was in the meeting. I got out of the meeting and I spent 20 minutes on the phone trying to find one of the host's neighbors to receive the luggage at 10PM. This, as well, was a big inconvenience. I asked for a different timing for the next day, but I was denied. When I called the claims department to make a complaint about this incident I was told I should have called earlier. I came from Spain to Chicago for a meeting that took place in GA. My schedule was very tight. I called the claims department as soon as I was available to call.

I think (foolishly). I'll just check in at a kiosk. Oddly enough, kiosk returns ""Flight is not open for check-in."" Okay, fine I go to check-in online. But my record locator isn't working, so I call customer service. I inform them I can't print my boarding passes. They give me a record locator and tell me to try checking in online.

I decide to chat with an Alaskan rep, who is friendly and tells me ""Yeah, Aer Lingus has a tendency to annoy a lot of travelers with their customer service approach."" This is 2019. ""Printing boarding passes"" is sort of a fundamental thing. The second rep I talked to on the phone told me ""We're going paperless,"" which would be great if literally any of their IT toolkits worked properly.

Basic customer service can't and shouldn't really be ignored - due to them, I spent 3 hours sitting outside the security zone at SEATAC because none of their agents were either trained or had permission to actually distribute boarding passes.

The Chicken which I had was this mushroom and chicken lasagna? Let’s just say I didn’t eat it. Down to preference though. There were some nice movie and TV selections. The screens were big too. The main problem was that after you had flown over Greenland, they forced you to put your window down so others could sleep. Now, we took off at around 11:30 AM in Dublin. This was around 13:00. After an hour of this, everybody was wide awake and it felt unnecessary. People would lift it up for a minute to look at the scenery so clearly people wanted to look outside. Fast forward a few hours, we are about one hour away. They serve this interesting pastry which I'm not sure what it was. It was okay.

""Unless your arrival flight and onward connecting flight is in Terminal 2 between the hours of 0400 and 1600, you will need to go landside to make your onward connecting flight"". First, my initial flight from Seattle was cancelled hours before departure. I accidentally checked my email before heading to the airport and found the notification. I called their customer support and was kept on hold for 90 mins, the customer service agent was rude and offered a reroute that arrives 2 days after my initial arrival date, which meant I will miss the main purpose of the trip and attend the wedding I am supposed to. When I asked him for an earlier option, he placed me on hold again and phone was disconnected after a min. I called again and waiting around 60 mins on hold again before I was automatically disconnected again. I called for a third time and finally got to an agent after almost 80 mins. She gave me another ticket that exchanged my 12 hour flight for a 24 hour flight with 10 hour wait in Boston. I accepted the offer since I had no other choice.

An hour later, I was not allowed to board to the plane by the aer lingus agent as I don't have a transit visa to Dublin.

I shall start by saying that I booked the flight many months ahead of my planned holiday. I booked with a travel agency and because of this Aer Lingus would not let me access their site to reserve a seat of my choice. Due to a medical issue I like an aisle seat. Eventually the Aer Lingus call centre let me pay for a seat. I was able to check-in online a few days before departure. The bag drop in Dublin was efficient and worked well. At present, Dublin is undergoing expansion and building work. I found myself placed on a transfer bus from one building to another and then entered what looked like an annex at the far end of the airport to stand number 35. So because of this passengers for this flight formed two sets of queues consecutively. One then had to walk towards the aircraft and passengers were left waiting in an exposed area for almost 15 mins. I did not see any assistance for elderly people, the frail or disabled people. The cabin crew were friendly, they made sure they presented the safety routine with a sense of purpose. The interior of the cabin was spotlessly clean. During this flight drinks and snacks were available for purchase. It was nice to see a native Italian speaker on the crew as most of the passengers were Italian people. The flight was just over 2 hours. During this time the captain only spoke twice and on both occasions he spoke so rapidly nobody could understand a word he said! There was no route map and the inflight magazine was ripped and tattered. The lavatory was clean. I noted that 2 of the cabin crew sat at the back of the flight for the duration of the journey and did little and allowed their colleagues to do all of the work. Disembarkation was quick and efficient. This direct flight is very convenient. There is a cheaper alternative with another airline. However. Aer Lingus has a more convenient departure time and by buying well in advance the price was reasonable for high season travel. Overall a rather reasonable experience. My concern though was the experience in Dublin airport and the lack of visible help for mobility impaired passengers. With all the building work going on better signage is needed too. A nice touch quite a few passengers commented on was the use of the Irish language. This is important in promoting Irish culture and heritage by the Irish national carrier. The aircraft used was an A320 and it was in the lovely dark green Aer Lingus colours rather than the new cut-back livery. I recommend Aer Lingus for their friendly and hardworking staff but with the proviso that they improve their communication in the airport. Overall it was a most pleasant experience.",Aer Lingus,A320,,

This review is a long time coming. I’d like to start off on a positive note. Betty and her colleagues working at the check-in desk at O’Hare on the evening of June 27, 2019 were life savers. These women went above and beyond to help me get on an earlier transfer flight, and deserve to be acknowledged. Unfortunately, all other circumstances surrounding my trip were nightmare-ish.  I chose to fly them again due to the cost and convenience from Chicago. During my last trip with Aer Lingus my luggage was lost during a connection from Dublin to Rome. Hours and hours were spent on the phone with essentially no help. The only reason I recovered my bag was pure luck. I went to the airport to see if miraculously my bag made it on the same flight the next day and it did. Albeit, it was sitting in the middle of the airport and no one ever contacted me that it had arrived! I received zero compensation for this inconvenience despite submitting a claim to the airline.  I booked with Aer Lingus again after the last disaster because the price was significantly less, and the in-flight experience is not terrible compared to some airlines. First, plans changed prior to my departure and the customer service line was worthless. Prepare to be on hold for an hour and then speak with an operator that is prepared to do nothing to assist you. If you must fly this airline and run into an issue with your departure, the only option is to work with personnel at the origin airport directly. Additionally, the check in process at every airport (aside from O’Hare) has been run with zero efficiency. At my recent check in departing from Amsterdam back to the USA, there were two employees working the desk. A family was dealing with an issue and it held up the line for an hour. It would have made much more sense to have them step aside and work with them after the majority of passengers had checked in. The line system itself is also ridiculous. There were two lines marked “check in” and “bag drop” but since most flyers were unable to check in online (another annoyance), it was unclear if there was any differentiation in the line. This created much discord between the passengers waiting and arguments as to whose turn was next. Although I arrived at the airport with almost three hours to spare, given the check-in snafu, I felt I had to rush through security and customs. As such, I did not check my boarding pass and only realized while arriving at security that the agent did not print out a boarding pass for my transfer flight. I rushed to the gate to inquire whether they could print a pass there because of the error at check-in. They told me that they could not assist me and my only option was to re-check in at the Dublin airport. I have an hour and 35 minute layover and also have to go through US customs, so how will this be feasible? Further, now our flight is delayed and there is a very solid chance I will miss my connection back to a Chicago. All in all, do your best to avoid flying this airline at all costs. The consistent terrible service and inefficiency you will encounter every step of the way is not worth any amount of savings.",Aer Lingus,,3,

The staff did not acknowledge this when I brought it to their attention!!! Sat for 2 hours before disembarking due to a wheel problem which needed a new wheel to be flown from Dublin the following morning. This part I get, unexpected things happen. To be honest, though, a spare wheel must be available on site. I don’t know much about flying a plane but it would seem pretty basic to me! Communication and clarification were sparse at best. Lost sheep - I know what they are now! No hotels booked, no details of the alternative flight, no plan made for any person in that flight (except the Aer Lingus staff who headed off to their pre-booked hotels). I will add that those on the flight included the elderly, infirm and wheelchair bound. It’s 1 am and entire flight left to our own devices to survive a late night in Lisbon. About 50 people slept on the airport floor, no water, no blankets. An €18 meal voucher received at about 1 pm on June 30th. Email confirmation received for 1 pm initially, then corrected to 2 pm, later ”confirmed” for 8.05 pm. This is farcical. It’s not what I expect from our national airline! The level of customer service is pathetic and unacceptable. I am annoyed that we could not have been told last night to arrive at a more reasonable hour. According to Ground Force in Lisbon there was never a slot available to fly at 2pm. In all of this time, there was no sign of any Aer Lingus staff. Ground Force may be contracted by Aer Lingus as airport admin but to be honest, we would deserve better than this! Aer Lingus did issue a message saying that air traffic control had restricted their ability to make a departure at 2 pm. Lisbon airport ground control told us there was no such slot available! Why can’t people tell the truth? Seemingly no slot was available and so I find myself sitting unnecessarily at the airport unable to even check in! Very, very poor reflection on Aer Lingus as a company. I understand perfectly that flights are delayed. I understand perfectly that things don’t always go to plan. I do not understand how events like this are handled so badly. What a pity as this is what defines an organisation. Frustrated, annoyed and tired.",Aer Lingus,,,

I then stood in another line to get help from the baggage drop. Two people in a row went on break as I got to the front of the line leaving one person to help close to 200 people still in line. Then she shut down her line to help priority board the people who’s gates had closed. Finally got my boarding pass print after almost two hours in line.

I waited almost 5 minutes for someone to notice the big red light over my bags and come assist. No one did. I asked the man sitting in the empty line next to me for help (business class assistance line) and he told me that he would not help and that I needed to go find someone who would help me. Finally managed to find help. All in all it took over two hours to print a boarding pass and check my bags. I emailed customer service to simply make them aware of these issues and they have been more than unhelpful. She told me she could not help because I would not give her a valid booking number even though I have explained several times that I do not have one for her airline since I did not book with them to begin with. She also decided to assign a gender role when speaking with me.

I have never in my life experienced such poor customer service. I booked a flight from BRU to SFO, but due to weather and slow ground operations at DUB airport I ended up missing my connection to SFO. I got rebooked onto a flight from DUB to JFK and JFK to SFO. Not only did this add 15 additional hours to my trip; they also managed to lose my bags in JFK. When I finally arrived in SFO at 3am after 30h of traveling, all 3 of my bags were missing. Additionally I had made a bid to upgrade to business class, based on the information I was given: a flight from DUB to SFO. However when I got rebooked, I got downgraded to economy for the second leg of the flight. And of course, availability isn’t always there, but when I raised this issue with them, they refused to compensate me or give me a partial refund. Over the course of 4 days I made over 16 phone calls, filled out multiple complaint claims, reached out to them on twitter. But they did nothing to help me retrieve my bags. I kept getting the same standard answer over and over again: As American Airlines were your final carrier they will need to trace the missing baggage. In our industry, it's the final carrier's responsibility to return the delayed baggage. They will work directly with us on your behalf to return the bags to you as soon as possible. And indeed, they tried to work with Aer Lingus. They put in 3 requests to get the bags transferred onto their system. But Aer Lingus was  unresponsive. I also reached out to Aer Lingus’s own delayed baggage department, who also put in a request and sent 2 emails to raise this issue. Yet again, not a single response from Aer Lingus. As a result, my bags are still being held hostage in the Aer Lingus terminal at JFK. After yet another attempt to raise awareness with Aer Lingus on twitter, I got shut down without any meaningful response. This seems to be their thing: making customers go away as fast as possible while providing zero help. Filing a complaint on Aer Lingus has been designed to frustrate and infuriate people.  Of course, things won’t always go according to plan, and often there’s not much that can be done about it, but a company like Aer Lingus should have a proper system for dealing with complaints in a timely manner, supported by caring staff.

Conclusion: avoid Aer Lingus if you are traveling as a family. They do not respect the value of family and no one is willing to take any responsibility after our horrible experience with them. What happened: We booked a returned flight from/to Toronto to Frankfurt. We were traveling with our 9 month old baby. Right after we booked and paid the tickets, we called the agent to request a baby bassinet and priority seats both ways immediately. We flew from Toronto to Frankfurt with bassinet, no problem. But the agent said we need to make another call before our return flight to reserve the bassinet. 48 hours before our return flight on April 1st, we called the Aer Lingus office in Germany where we would board the flight. They told us they have no access to the seating system and asked us to go to the airport counter for requesting the bassinet. We arrived three and a half hours before the scheduled flight time to check in and to request the bassinet (We were the second in line after the counter was opened). The person on the counter told us, she has no access to the flight from Dublin to Toronto, which is the long flight after our first short flight from Frankfurt to Dublin. She asked us to request the bassinet seat when we transferred at Dublin airport. I asked her, there will only be less than 2 hours transfer time, wouldn't the seats all be taken? What if we do not get a bassinet seat? She said she cannot help and we can only go and find out there. We arrived at Dublin airport, when we went to check in for the second flight, which is going to be 7 and half hours long from Dublin to Toronto. The lady at the counter said there is no bassinet seats anymore and she cannot help us. She told us rudely that there is nothing she can do and we can only go board the plane and ask the cabin crew for the seat change. We boarded the plane EI129, and of course it is full and there was no single crew member who was willing or able to help us at all. We were sitting in the middle seats. Carrying a 9 month old baby at hand. No extra seats or spaces were beside us. And all the crew members were very unfriendly to us. One of them told us it was because there was a last minute cabin change so two families with babies could not get the bassinet seats including us. They even told us: sorry this happened every week I saw many families always left without their requested prioirity seats in the end especially for Sunday and Monday flight. During the whole 7 and a half flight, we did not feel well at all. No one helped us, no one cared about us. Even when my husband was standing beside the hallway to rock the baby and tried to let her sleep because our seats were so tight and small she couldn't nap, one of the crew member came to us and said we cannot stand there. (The seat belt sign was not on at the moment). The baby was crying nonstop because she was so tired but kept getting disturbed by these actions. We asked to speak to the cabin manager three times, and throughout the whole flight not once he came to communicate with us. We felt deeply sad about the unfortunate experience.

We were dismayed to find there was very little leg room, much less than the other rows, and the seat backs could not be reclined. The seats were in Row 11 which was immediately in front of an emergency exit. However there was no indication on the online seat selection plan that there were any issues with these seats - the fact that they were shown as available to reserve at the same price as seats in adjacent rows surely implies they would be of the same standard. My partner was particularly upset as she suffers from arthritis and severe back pain - it would have been intolerable for her in these seats on a four hour flight. We asked a steward if we could move, and he said we could once the plane had reached safe altitude. However there was no apology. We did move then, to seats which were perfectly satisfactory, but we were lucky that there were such spare seats available! Aer Lingus appear to be selling sub-standard seats under false pretences. You might say that we should have checked first with Seatguru but it should be clear from the airline website.

A small but decent selection of movies was available on the individual back of the seat entertainment system. - I was able to watch two movies on this relatively short flight of less than seven hours. Flight attendants were friendly. Too many announcements, even for a fleeting turbulence, was annoying and interruptive.

Bag drop was efficient but there were no uniformed staff around to help at all. There were elderly people and a non-English speaking family struggling to use the automated bag drop. I assisted 2 elderly people. This is not good enough. Boarding was not well organised at all and no announcement was made with regards to making a queue and / or the boarding order. Passengers were allowed far too much hand luggage and there was no consistency in how this was managed alas. The cabin crew failed to assist an older lady with her bag with regards to accessing an overhead locker. Announcements from the captain were robotic and the crew seemed to be rather tired and disinterested. I had one empty seat next to me and an otherwise very full flight and the window seat was occupied by a passenger clearly under the influence of alcohol. To my astonishment the cabin crew sold this person more alcohol during the flight! Landing was efficient and disembarkation slow and chaotic as luggage had been dispersed all over the plane by passengers with too much luggage. I am not at all pleased with Aer Lingus on this occasion and think they should be far more diligent and responsible than was the case on this occasion.

At 7pm flight was cancelled when half of passengers had already boarded aircraft. Communication after that was atrocious. Not sure whether flight was cancelled due to crew working hours limit. Passengers spoke individually to Gate Staff and asked them to communicate over the intercom to the whole group which they wouldn't do. No written communication was given. Issues which had to be resolved without any guidance from Aer Lingus were a) How to rebook to a later flight (24 hours later earliest available) b) How to exit airport as we had passed through passport control c) Where to get our bags d) Accomodation options e) Compensation options according to EU law No food vouchers or accomodation vouchers were given. Tried to ring Aer Lingus at 3am hoping it would be quiet. Was put on hold for 30 mins with no indication of when call would be answered. Filled in a complaint form on their website. Response was ""A member of our Guest Relations team will review your request and personally reply to you within the next 60 business days"" That's almost 3 months. Aer Lingus has to do some serious work in the customer relations area if they don't want to go out of business. As this would be a semi regular occurence it would have been helpful to get a handout showing what to do and covering a-e above.  A good airline is one that handles the situation rather than abandoning their passengers when a flight is cancelled",Aer Lingus,A320,,

Due to the storm our flight was delayed several hours. My friend and I had a travel time over 30 hours. The Aer Lingus Customer Service Desk had only 1 person behind the counter when the incident happened and other 5-6 counters were empty for several hours. The managers told us that the Customer Service desk will be closed at 8pm, and there was nothing Aer Lingus can do at the moment. It would appear to have been more helpful if the managers took charge and provided a solution, looked for solutions, or provided some helpful constructive customer service. We were given breakfast tickets and were later told that the breakfast ticket was unusable in other venues and only usable by the cafe, which claimed to open 24 hours but didn’t have any food for us and Aer Lingus had closed already. So we also used our own money later to buy snacks. Then we found out that there was a difference between a meal ticket (which was apparently able to be used at any restaurant/supermarket in the airport) and a breakfast ticket (which was only to be used at the cafe). Since we connected the flight from Amsterdam to Dublin early AM, the entire day we were with Aer Lingus. Nothing was done, every response from our were questions were brushed off with unhelpful response. I believe this airline failed to remember the fact the only food they provided was a pack of cookies, therefore we couldn’t use the tickets and was given only 1 pack of water. I would like to highlight that this complaint is to the fact that Aer Lingus did not provide solutions nor notify us of the differences between the 2 tickets. I do not think I will ever fly with this airline again, I understand that weather conditions affected the flight patterns and caused delay but the customer service was horrible.

The biggest issue and really the reason I even chose to write this review is that they lost our luggage. The only reason we took this flight and the connecting one was because it was exclusively through Aer Lingus and we figured that with a 6 hour layover in Dublin they would have time to move our bags from one plane to the other. This was too much to ask, however, and despite being told they would transfer the bags they did not. (I am speaking for me and my friend) Once in Spain we learned that another passenger that flew from the UK and then connected to Barcelona from Dublin had the exact same issue, however his story was even stupider since he actually happened to see that his luggage had been unloaded and placed in the carousel in Dublin airport. Keep in mind this was just by chance, he grabbed his bag and told the staff that Air Lingus was supposed to have taken care of this and should have put it on the Barcelona bound plane. Despite him correcting this mistake and giving them another chance to fix it, they till forgot his bag in Dublin. That is pure incompetence. So now me and my friend are in Barcelona for a two month long study abroad, havent heard anything from Aer Lingus and have literally one change of clothes and nothing else.

We made an online bid to upgrade our original economy class tickets to business, and successfully purchased them for a very reasonable price. A newish A330 on the outbound leg, with very comfortable lay-flat seats and impeccable service with perfect menu selections of both food and drinks. Very smooth flight too. The only complaint is that they limit your complimentary WiFi to only 400MB of traffic, and it was excruciatingly slow at times. The flight from Shannon to JFK was a complete opposite, and it really felt like we were flying a third-world airline. For some reason, Aer Lingus chooses to fly 20 year old 757-200's on this route that clearly show their age both inside and out. We were delayed departing out of SNN for about 50 minutes although this is not a very busy airport, and there was departure hold. About 1.5 hour into the flight we hit a patch of very rough air, and spent some very uncomfortable moments wondering if this old bird would make it through. The rest of the flight was smooth. Out of three lavatories in Economy, only two were operational, and boy, did they reek of urine! The seats were old-style Recaro and not too uncomfortable with decent leg room. My family's three seat backs had trouble staying up, and there was no WiFi available. On the positive note: the food in Economy was very good with decent-sized portions.

The seats were a bit cramped, however the in-flight amenities more than made up for this. The food service was on point, I opted for the Shepard's Pie, which was quite tasty and chocolate mousse for dessert was outstanding. My only complaint was the price of the beverage service. I felt that at least one round of drinks should be complimentary for an international flight.  In flight entertainment was satisfactory, with an engaging selection of movies. I did not purchase in-flight WiFi access. It was in the range of about 35 Euro (or somewhere thereabouts), which I think is ridiculous for less than 6 hours of internet access. I am giving the ground service an average rating. The announcements were difficult to hear, as the gate agent seemed to be whispering into the microphone. The gate agents also called people to the desk at random, which can make one nervous about being ""bumped"" from the flight. If you are going to call individuals to the counter at the gate, at least announce the reason, then request the names. This would give all of those waiting some more peace of mind. Also, I purchased Aer Lingus club passes during on-line check-in the night before. Apparently, our club passes for JFK were not processed due to the lounge being full, according to the agent there. It would have been nice if Aer Lingus had posted at least a note of caution on their website, that if the lounge is full, passes will not be honored. At least my credit card was not charged for this. The agent operating the lounge could have also used a lesson in professionalism. So, I have good news and bad news. Let's start with the bad news: Gate agents who needed additional training.

I flew from New York JFK to Dublin with little problems. We were able to check in on time and fly on time. The leg room was much less roomier than most other planes I’ve flown on and the seats were not comfortable. However we did depart and arrive without any problems. The problems occurred when our flight from Dublin to New York JFK was canceled due to a snow storm. I totally understand why the flight was canceled and am fine with that. What upsets me is that I called Aer Lingus at various times throughout the day, being on hold for about an hour each time, and when I called Aer Lingus customer service would tell me there was nothing they could do each time. Aer Lingus customer service said to go to the airport and wait until they put us on a flight. Aer Lingus closes at night until 9am eastern standard time when they were unable to get us on a plane because they were not open for phone calls. I do not understand how an airline closes customer service for phone calls in general, but especially when they cancel a flight late at night leaving passengers with no sense of when they are arriving home. In Ireland, the time is 1300 hours, at 0900 hours eastern standard time, which means we were kicked out of our hotel with no idea what we were to do. Luckily after finding an outside source from a travel agent, we were able to get a flight to Connecticut, on Friday (we were originally leaving Wednesday), which then we had to drive 3 hours to New York. Without contacting this outside source we would most likely still not have any flight home. We had to pay for two more nights for hotels, which I understand there was a storm and flights were canceled, however Aer Lingus would still not have us on a flight. Aer Lingus never emailed us or called us one to let us know the status of the plane, we had to call each and every time. Besides being upset about the customer service telling us they couldn’t help us and closing until 9am, we were very upset with the staff at Aer Lingus airport in Dublin. We went to a Aer Lingus desk to ask a question about where the lounge was and the lady behind the desk said she couldn’t help us because we were not at her gate. This was a simple question of where something was as anyone who worked in the airport could help us, but this lady who worked for Aer Lingus could not spend one second to even point in a direction. The gate she was at was not boarding and no one was on any type of line to speak to her.

On the way back the plane still had rubbish from the previous flight that came in from Dublin. We didn't buy anything on board as we are frequent fliers and understand that the prices are too inflated. My biggest issue is the way that Aer Lingus do not make it clear that their policy is to seat families together. They don't tell you this as they want you to book the seats together for 9 euro which is a complete sham and hopefully the Civil Aviation Authority will stop this money making deception. If you wait 30 hours before you fly you can all sit together for no cost as long as you don't mind where it is on the plane, But what if you don't have access to internet for the return flight? For example Faro airport does not accept the e tickets? As I said I booked this flight for a fairly decent price, I didn't buy anything on board and did not book a seat ( by 5 persons return this would have inflated our holiday spending by 90 euro).

This could happen to any company, however they did not bother to give any information until 5min prior to boarding. The staff were stressed and they rushed the passengers. If any passenger dared display any sign of discomfort they were both dismissive and outright disrespectful. In my case, the rude behavior came when I tried to explain to the young man who simply stuck a tag to my very modestly sized carry on luggage to check it in for a lack space in the overhead compartment, that I had made sure my bag fits under the sit in front of me. But, he did not have time for a 10 seconds conversation. He stubbornly continued to harass me at the door of the plane and refused to hear a word. I did not give him way and ended up peacefully placing my bag under the sit in front of me. After that, they finally explained to us while in the plane that they had to change planes and we would have to sit in this plane another 40min before being allowed to take off. All this stress, the rude behavior, the rush to board so we can sit wait in the plane. It's one thing to be late, it's another thing to inflict such chaos and discomfort to customers.

Inflight service consisted of snacks and drinks to buy - nothing special but fine for a short flight. Cabin noise was fine for a prop - but I had my noise cancelling headphones to help. On time performance and speedy transit through Cork - There was a passport control - which surprised me. Passports were not checked on the return. Photo id is needed to board. Return flight similar, except push back was 7 mins early and due to favourable tailwinds we arrived 25 mins early. Full flight - but despite narrow seats, I was comfortable. Disembarked Terminal 1 via a bus which took us to the UK domestic arrivals - so no passport control. Overall an enjoyable flight. So much better than the Flybe service to Belfast on the Dash 8 Q400. The ATR 72 seems a better plane.",Aer Lingus,ATR 72-600,,

Time of flight 16.10 EI0359.  I arrived at gate 337 at 15.45. I was delayed going thru security as there was a very big crowd and the lines were going very slowly. I had a tub of hair conditioner and my bag was checked and tube removed. After I was refused entry I was told by german staff to ‘go down and out’ I was asking to go to customer services.  Eventually one staff member showed me an exit and I went down to customer service.  They just said gate was closed. Later I rang Aer Lingus and explained my story to a pleasant staff member. She asked me if they said anything about going on standby which they didn't. They didn't make any effort to make any other arrangements or explain about the extra €75 to book another flight which is posted on your website. I feel the experience was shocking and customer service was atrocious.  I then had to book another Aer Lingus flight costing €158 to get home next when it should have only cost €75. How was I supposed to know if there is no one willing of able to tell me. I feel that I got a raw deal and no help. If you are operating flights to/from there you should have some decent representative who can advise when a mini crises presents.

To start I decided to bring my wife on a short break of 5 nights to Alicante for our upcoming 10 year wedding anniversary.I thought that I would book a holiday with 2 of our friends and without the kids which is the first time ever. We booked flights to Alicante flying from and back to Belfast for the 21-26 Sept 17 only to be emailed that due to operational commitments that the flights are cancelled. We got compensated and sorted things out, no big deal. We book for Dublin and arrive that day nearly 4 hours early only to be told that due to technical faults our flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours give or take. We got over that as going on a holiday even though we knew that because of their delay we were going to miss out on a full night in our apartment. The real mess started when we boarded the plane. To start we were on the same row 13 with 2 of us on each side. The group of people sitting behind us were drunk when they were allowed on board and they sat directly behind our rows about 3 to 4 rows on each side and the worst was sitting right behind my seat. She was in her mid 40’s and I couldn’t believe the filthy language coming out of her mouth in such a small enclosed area. She was making constant burping noises, cursing, everything that she had to say was shouted or screamed and constant sexual remarks to the male passengers across and behind her. The head flight attendant knew these people were full of drink because before the flight even took off they were shouting and roaring so she comes down a row in front of us and starts telling them that she can take anyone she wants off now who are acting to loud or she has the power to divert the plane at any stage if she feels fit and then disappeared straight away and left the customers to listen to the filth for the rest of the flight (Unbelievable). Just before take off another flight attendant asked me was I ok and I turned around and said to her was she kidding me and with that also disappeared. Again same thing happened during the flight.  So we keep there the whole flight listening to this when 10 mins before landing the head flight attendant comes down to me and says are we ok which I really couldn’t believe just 10 mins to go so I tell her everything and said that it was a disgrace and she then says that people who were sitting 2 rows up from us that she moved them to the front of the plane because of the noise and brutal language. This I couldn’t believe as we were directly in front of the noise which I let her know. During all this my wife starts to cry infront of this attendant because of how upset she was that we were left there for the flight listening to all that was going on. In getting off the plane I also let the captain know and told him that it was a joke that he let them on the plane in the first place. I pointed out that if we had reported the noise to the flight attendant (Which she knew was going on) that next thing we would meet this group in the terminal or at our resort and end up getting harassed or worse.",Aer Lingus,,,

As our flight was delayed and the lounge is that of IAG partner BA we were thrown out after the last BA flight left. The only upside was that the flight crew and Dublin ground staff to their credit are for the most part professional and pleasant. But Aer Lingus agents abroad can be rude -  that I was told by their agents in TLS since (on a flight my daughter was taking) ""we don't do customer service if you have a problem with that complain to the police"".

My lasting impression is that this is a no-frills airline trying to put on a show like they aren't a no-frills airline. Everything was pretty much lack lustre, but they did get us from A to B to C and back again, on time. Positives: The four planes we travelled on were clean, tidy and comfortable. Cabin crew were very friendly and professional. They've got some good and experienced people working for them. We travelled in peak season so the flights weren't cheap, but outside of that time, they are one of the cheaper long haul airlines. Terms and conditions were made very clear during booking and check in. Connection through Dublin was easy and clear if a bit convoluted. Negatives: Pre-flight customer service was poor. Booking and online check in allowed for no seat selections to be made. At no point in the booking/check in process were we able to select seats, which was important to us due to the age and health of the travellers. Only through extended negotiation with contracted check-in staff at airport, who could see our needs, were we able to secure appropriate seats. Which left for a nerve-wracking build up to travelling. Special meal selections were inaccurate from booking - luckily we called up in advance to confirm. Food on outbound leg was good, but they ran out of the chicken option very quickly. Food on the way home was terrible. Entertainment selection is okay. The technology is poor, though. Had to reset my or my companions' screens at least once on each leg. Several functions did not work. Baggage handling is poor. Had a 2.5 hour wait at Toronto for baggage to come through. One lost bag. Despite which party was at fault, it was very poor customer service from Aer Lingus from that point on, with nobody to speak to at the company, and given telephone numbers cutting out upon connection. Seemingly there is no customer service department. Very few representatives on the ground. Would travel with them again given the cost, but with low expectations.",Aer Lingus,A330-200,2,

I think 30 hours to allocate seats is a bit too short notice. On arrival DUB T2 was mental and the automatic bag drop was brilliant and really user friendly. Boarding was done in a very relaxed manner by courteous staff and the flight itself was lovely. Really friendly staff with a bit of banter thrown in and plenty of updates from the flight deck.

With Aer Lingus, the flight is usually reasonably comfortable - the arrival process is often a nightmare. Arriving at Dublin late at night, the aircraft usually parks away from Terminal 2 and there is a long long walk through a labyrinth of internal corridors. As noted by another reviewer, if it is an Aer Lingus regional flight, a compulsory bus tour of Dublin Airport is added to the experience. Arriving at Manchester on Aer Lingus also involves being bussed around that airport. Last Monday, the ground crew decided to economise on the number of buses. Our bus took an age to get to Arrivals. A hot day and severe overcrowding on the bus caused some passengers to panic. Not a pleasant experience. Aer Lingus does not speak to passengers. I could not find a phone number and I am told that Customer Services doesn't have a phone. Very good for cost control and efficiency, I am sure. Not so good if they want repeat business.

I had plenty of leg and knee room despite being over 6 feet tall. Seat padding is a little thin, so if you are sensitive to that you might consider one of those airline seat pads. We were thoroughly impressed by the cabin crew - consistently friendly, helpful, cheerful. Unlike on the American carriers, they did not simply serve the meal and disappear. They were very helpful with our young children as well. Flights left the gate a bit late but arrived on schedule. The captain made such a soft landing at JFK that the whole plane clapped!

Andrew Layne (United States) 19th May 2017",unk,"✅ Verified Review |  I was traveling on Vacation from JFK to LIN, and this was my very first time using Aer Lingus. I don't plan to ever fly with Aer Lingus again. Some things are understandable and are outside of an airline's control. Many of the issues I had experienced were purely poor customer service. Upon arrival at JFK airport, I was immediately turned off at the fact that Aer Lingus is not part of TSA-Pre, meaning I had to go through the standard security check which takes a very long time. So I finally make it to my gate, and I am waiting to start boarding the aircraft. Our flight was supposed to depart at 17:30. 17:30 rolls around and I had to go up and ask the attendant at the gate to find out the plane wasn't cleared to land and had to continue flying past JFK to Boston? I've never heard of this happening before, but I wasn't too irritated as my connecting flight didn't depart until 0700 Ireland time. Well, the flight delay went on for over two hours, and I ended up missing my connecting flight. The delay was understandable, and I assume not the fault of the airline, but communication in regards to the delay was nonexistent. Here is where the real frustration and poor customer service begins. A chaotic, disorganized line forms at the customer service counter to arrange for new connecting flights. This line is so poorly organized that many people were waiting in the wrong line for a half hour, and the flight attendants were the ones who directed them to those lines! Exhausted after an over two-hour delay as well as a 5-hour flight, I wait in this line for 4 hours. This is not an exaggeration but timed. Finally, we get to the front of the line and are told we can't fly out until tomorrow, causing us to lose a full day of our vacation. Aer Lingus in no way compensated us for this inconvenience, or loss of a vacation day, or even offered us one of those $5 drink vouchers, nothing. They sent everyone to the same hotel that couldn't fly out overnight, which was then overbooked and many had to leave that hotel to find accommodations for the evening. This isn't the end of my poor customer service experience. Arriving at the airport for the flight back, with two hours leeway till our flight leaves, we get into a line that wraps around the check-in counter and stretches all the way down through part of the hallway. Aer Lingus had 1 check in counter. There were three desks and only one attendant. I got to my gate right before they shut the doors. I could not imagine what I would have done if I missed that flight and was stranded in another country. Last but not least, the chance to leave feedback to Aer Lingus ended the day I landed back in JFK. I guess they expect me to rate my experience while I'm flying with them. All in all, pick any other than Aer Lingus, and I pray no one else has to go through what I had to go through and have travel completely ruin their vacation.",Aer Lingus,,4,2

This is in reference to my flight with Aer Lingus El108 which was scheduled to depart on Tuesday, April 18th from JFK to Dublin, Ireland. Prior to departure I received an e.mail advising that the flight was delayed from 8:50 pm to 10:45pm. On arrival at the Airport my family and I were greeted by non Aer Lingus staff and handed a piece of paper apologizing for the disruption to our travel plans - the Flight had been cancelled and no explanation was given as to why. Included was an “800” number (800-585-0672) to call and rebook or get a refund. I immediately started to call the 800 number which constantly rang with no response - some people were put on hold for a considerable amount of time and had to end up hanging up. When I approached a representative from Aer Lingus, who was constantly on his cell phone and not very approachable, I was basically told they couldn't guarantee that I would get on another flight on April 19th (the next day). Our travel plans were time sensitive since we were attending my niece’s wedding and my sister was acting as the mother of the bride since my niece’s Mum has passed away. I had no choice but to rebook flights with another carrier so we were guaranteed to at least attend the wedding! I called Aer Lingus the following morning and finally got a response to find out that all Aer Lingus flights were already booked out. In addition, I was told that the representative at the Airport should have informed us that they would do all in their power to get us on a flight the next day. In this case Aer Lingus should be responsible for the extra charges that was imposed on us because of their lack of responsibility. I returned from my two week trip to discover that Customer Service didn't have the common courtesy to respond to my email nor had they refunded, as promised, the money for the flight that was cancelled. I had to waste my time and energy dealing with their incompetent customer service and had to explain my case again and demanded a refund. I finally got an email of apology about the cancelled flight and the importance of reliable and safe travel and that I'm in total agreement with, however, I have a difficult time dealing with disinterested staff who appear not to care about their customers. Since Aer Lingus did not make any effort to resolve this issue, in a timely fashion, I will no longer consider Aer Lingus as a carrier of choice, nor will I recommend Aer Lingus as a travel option to others. Quite honestly Aer Lingus lag behind their counterparts when it comes to inflight courtesy and customer service.

This is the second year I have flown with Aer Lingus and I plan to make it an annual event. From the service onboard to the lounges and service on the ground, both trips were superb. The Business Class cabin from Chicago to Dublin on the A330 is spacious and very comfortable with lie-flat seats. The left side of the plane consists of single seats, and I was happily ensconced in seat 3A. The middle section is double seats and the right section is a mixture of double and single seats. 99% of the seats have aisle access. The movie selection is less extensive than on other airlines, but there are still good choices. The food is excellent, the linens and cutlery very attractive and the FAs were smiling and helpful throughout the 7 hour flights. The Aer Lingus arrival lounge in Dublin is comfortable and had enough amenities to make the 2 hour layover on the way to Geneva very refreshing. There is no Business Class on the European flights but international Business passengers can select the premium seats at the front of the plane. Unlike British, Swiss and others, there is no charge for seat selection on Aer Lingus if traveling in Business. A few years ago, I paid $90 to have a window seat in British Airways' Club World cabin and have fumed about it ever since. Returning to the States is the best feature of Aer Lingus as you pass through U.S. Customs in their U.S. Pre-clearance area in Dublin and do not have to go through customs or passport control upon arrival in the States; you simply collect your luggage and leave the airport. The new Business Class lounge after U.S. Pre-clearance is superb. It is called 51st and Green and has a view of the runways from every seat and table. There is an excellent buffet, superbly stocked bar, terrific coffee and desserts, lounge chairs, shower room, and the staff is efficient and pleasant. I cannot recommend Aer Lingus for travel from the U.S. to Europe more highly. Their rates are lower than any other airline's Business Class if you buy at least 30 days in advance and, in fact, are competitive with full Economy fares on some of the other carriers to Europe.",Aer Lingus,A330-200,4,5

Patrick Jordan (Ireland) 14th February 2017",unk,"✅ Verified Review |  Dublin to London Heathrow return. I was planning a day trip to London, and as I hadn’t travelled through Heathrow for over two years, I was curious to see how it had evolved since 09th July 2014 when Aer Lingus moved their operation from Heathrow Terminal 1 to Terminal 2. At the time, four main benefits arising from moving to T2 were heavily publicised:  Public transport within 15 minutes of landing. Luxurious Gold Circle Lounge within minutes of check in.  State of the art facilities. A seamless faster security and check in process. In addition, this was my first booking since the introduction of Aer Lingus’ loyalty programme, now named “Aer Club”. The booking process on Aer Lingus website remains broadly the same. The three fare types are now named Saver, Plus & Advantage with each earning a different amount of tier credits. One benefit I noticed is that when selecting the Plus fare, all seats are now included as complimentary: heretofore the front rows had to be paid for. As I was travelling within the 30 day window, I was able to check in immediately and print my boarding passes. I arrived at Dublin Airport at 7.00am for my 0845 am flight. I wanted to enquire about changing my seat on the outbound leg, and I called to the Gold Circle check in desk. Staff greeted me with a smile and within seconds had issued me with a new boarding card, and wished me a pleasant flight. My current Aer Club tier is Silver which includes fast track security. Only two people were in front of me and I was airside within a couple of minutes. I had a quick look around the bookshop and made my way to the Lounge, where I was greeted by the same staff with whom I dealt at the Gold Circle desk. We joked about the speed with which she moved from the check-in area to the lounge. Definitely the complete antithesis of the fabled lounge dragon! At approximately 8.20am, I made my way to gate 409 where boarding was underway. There are two separate boarding lines: General and Priority (for Aer Club members, flexible ticket holders) and it works very well. While walking towards the airbridge, passengers sitting in the rear half of the aircraft are directed towards steps at the rear door, and the front half board via the airbridge. This speeds up the boarding process, particularly on busy flights. The A320 was clean , and cabin crew warmly welcomed passengers. After a safety briefing and flight information from the Captain, we were underway quickly. During the flight, I indulged in the Irish Breakfast. Not the cheapest at 10 euro, but very tasty indeed. We landed on time in Heathrow, and after a short taxi were on stand at 11am. We deplaned quickly, and  I was sitting on the Tube at 11.15am.",Aer Lingus,A321,,

About 40 mins before landing the man behind just pushed my wife's seat forward aggressively several times. We called the cabin crew, and the CSD came down to us. Despite the couple behind being quite drunk, and very aggressive, her way of dealing with the situation was to ask us to put our seats upright. We complied with her request and then had to put up with our seats being kicked and loud comments for the remainder of the flight.  This is the worst experience I have ever had on any airline, and it was compounded by the way it was dealt with. At no point did the CSD speak to them and ask them to calm down, nor did she ask them to stop disturbing us. It felt like we were being punished by the airline, and that the most aggressive passengers were being rewarded. If they were that drunk over three hours into the flight then it had to be due to drink sold onboard to  them, and this is unacceptable.

Samuel Godefroy (Canada) 23rd August 2016",unk,"✅ Verified Review | Dublin to Toronto with Aer Lingus. Attempted to make changes to my reservation on the Aer Lingus web site - impossible. The online features are useless. Called the call centre to make a seat selection. I had to wait over 25 minutes before getting answered by someone who was not willing to help. Had a hard time understanding me, and nothing could be done. Not possible to add a frequent flyer program, not possible to make a seat selection for the return flight. At the airport, no one from the ground staff seemed to know which airline Aer Lingus cooperates with, as far as mileage accumulation. Qantas lists Aer Lingus as a partner on its website - so will try to handle later. The lounge in Dublin is spacious and well equipped. Good internet connection for work. The saving grace is the quality of the flight and inflight service. FAs were simply amazingly nice. The food and drinks were of quality and the seat quite comfortable. I used the single seat option available on this aircraft for rows 1 and 3. Arrival into Toronto was a bit delayed due to a delayed departure. Chaos to recover luggage at YYZ T3 - but that must be the airport's fault not the airline. Overall, if Aer Lingus fixes some issues with ground staff and call centre (more training required obviously), the product has great potential. Can't wait for them to rejoin Oneworld.",Aer Lingus,Boeing 757,5,

All of the segments of the ticket were on one ticket and the whole ticket was under Aer Lingus and the last segment was under Aer Lingus but operated by United. My wife and I flew together and we each checked a second bag. We paid the fee for the second bag in Madrid but our bags were not checked all the way through even though we had one ticket. In Chicago we picked up our bags and went to recheck them at the United gate and they told us that United had no relationship with Aer Lingus,  and that as a result we would have to pay again. Basically they did not give us a choice, they said pay and go to the gate or go back to the international terminal and speak to Aer Lingus which would mean missing our flight.  I can´t believe what happened. The next day we called and spoke to someone with Aer Lingus, gave all our information and receipt numbers and no one ever contacted us. So we called again and and again. My wife spoke to at least 4 different agents. One told her that other was dealing with our case and then another who she spoke to after, had no idea. Finally after about 6 phone calls and hours wasted she was told to send our receipts to prove that we were charged by both United and Aer Lingus. We´ve sent all this information on August 5th an till this day no one has even contacted us. Every time she called she would ask to speak to a supervisor, and was never aloud to speak to anybody apart from a regular agent who had no control over anything.

Why check in passengers and make them stand in a small area, when the plane hasn't disembarked it's previous passengers? This shows a total lack of regard for the elderly, people not in full health and people completing long journeys. After 40 minutes of standing we went back past the check in area to the seats so the kids could sit comfortably and complained to Aer Lingus staff, not that they seemed to care as they were to interested in chatting amongst themselves. And why does it take 6 staff to check in a small plane?  Unfortunately things on the plane weren't much better, poorly dressed staff looking tired and rough, we couldn't understand the lady on the mic reading the safety statement, neither could the girl demonstrating this as they were in and out of sync, lack of professional refreshment service provided as the first thing they were asked for off the menu seemed to confuse the stewardess and she dissappeared for a while and returned with a no we don't have that. It was only a sandwich that was requested by another passenger. Obviously there are good staff with Aer Lingus also, but this is spoilt by a poor few and bad practices. I would recommend management in Aer Lingus should get on a Singapore Airlines flight to see how it should be done, very well dressed staff throughout a long flight, very attentive and polite to any need or request, each one of them asked the name of our kids and used it when talking to them (Aer Lingus staff didn't bother to ask, the chewing gum was obviously in the way), very well organised at check in time even though dealing with a great deal more passengers and it didn't take six of them to do it either! Come on Aer Lingus staff you can do much better than this, and it wouldn't take much, just a better regard for your customers and some manners.",Aer Lingus,,,

Toronto to Dublin leg was to be on Aer Lingus. When we reached the Airport to Check in, the agent said that we could not fly, because the flight was cancelled and asked us to call their booking agent to rebook our tickets. Their agent, after hours of waiting, said that she has booked us on Emirates for the next day. So we went home. Then when we checked the Emirates site, there was no such booking. We called up Emirates and they said that, Aer Lingus had only made a reservation but had not ticketed it, so it got cancelled automatically. So we tried calling Aer Lingus again and after hours of being on hold, Aer Lingus finally said that we were booked on Air Canada for Jan 8th. So we went to the Airport and at the check in counter, the agent said that she could not find a ticket for our baby. So Aer Lingus, when re-issuing our ticket had re-issued only 4 tickets instead of 5 and had missed out on our infant. So we called them again to try to fly on the next flight, but they said that they could not do anything. Then we again went home at 10.30pm with the 3 children and all the luggage. The whole night we kept trying to call Aer Lingus and finally in the morning, they said that we had to buy a fully fresh ticket for our baby and that they would reimburse it. So we went to our agent to buy the ticket and somehow they fixed our infant's ticket for us. But later while returning, when we checked with Etihad, our original carrier, they said that Aer Lingus would not have been able to reimburse the ticket fare, since it is not their ticket that we are buying - and it is Air Canada's ticket. So even that was cheating from the side of Aer Lingus. So my personal advice to anyone out there is to never trust or travel on Aer Lingus.",Aer Lingus,Boeing 757,,

Second bad thing is the seating which is tightly stacked together for minimal legroom whilst the backrest is inclined at an unusually low angle.

It's the low-cost mentality - the customer service reps I spoke to on the phone told me they are not allowed to return calls or even send emails, and each time when I pushed on this issue (that I should not have to chase them up for their mistake) the response was that maybe someone would get in touch in a couple of days. When I asked to speak with a manager, I was told each time that none was available. I was repeatedly told me to wait a week and then call them back to see if it was resolved.

Once we got to the airport, the counter was closed, we tried again, over and over to call, still no luck. So there we were with 4 adult flights that couldn't be honored. We had to rebook on another airline and spend another 10 hours via Germany to get to Dublin. This was at a great cost to us. We had a baby with us and my husband with a very serious heart condition. It was a very difficult situation which was made worse to not be able to communicate with anyone from Aer Lingus. If it were not for the help of a woman at the airport in Rome who finally connected with someone, we were told we were out luck. There's one flight out of Rome and tough luck if you miss it!

We arrived at Dublin airport around 5am and there were long lines for the Aer Lingus check-in desk even though we had checked in online we were shown to the main queue. A member of my group was using crutches and so standing in the line was uncomfortable. A member of Aer Lingus staff who was directing passengers to the various desks was extremely rude an was shouting at many of the passengers. We had pre-booked assistance for the member of our group using crutches but we asked the at the check-in desk there were steps to the plane - to which she told us that it was definitely an air bridge to the plane so accessibility wouldn't be an issue. We arrived at the gate to find that there was no air bridge to the plane and there was stairs down to the tarmac. To which a lady here was helpful but the member requiring assistance would have to wait behind. When the other staff scanned the passports there was a computer issue with one which the staff couldn't figure out. As my passport already scanned and I waited for my family member I was rudely told to ""Just go and board the plane!"". As I went down the stairs I was met by several different doors/corridors with no signage or member of staff to point us in the correct direction. After spending several minutes lost, myself and a few other passengers finally made it to the tarmac where two members of Aer Lingus ground staff were standing chatting then were again somewhat rude while taking us to the steps. Onboard we waited for the member of our group who required the assistance to get on to the plane. As she made her way down the aisle to sit beside us, she was told to ""just sit there"" in a row by herself about 5 rows away from us. Because she was not seated beside us we were not able to help getting bags/crutches from the overhead locker and no staff helped. The return flight was no improvement on Aer Lingus part. As the flight was full we couldn't place the crutches in the locker, after trying to get the attention of the crew and being ignored, my family member had to sit with the crutches upright in front of her for the whole journey - which wasn't even remarked upon by cabin crew doing the usual ""tray up, bags away safety check"". Furthermore, staff were extremely rude. As this flight was departing late in the evening and was delayed a lady in the seat across the aisle from me had fallen asleep before takeoff. A male crew member then proceeded to stop during the safety demonstration, stomp over to her, nip her arm and shake her quite aggressively, rudely telling her pay attention! I was shocked and the lady seemed upset at this. After years of happily flying Aer Lingus I doubt I would again unless no other alternative.",Aer Lingus,,,

With a Kindle in the seat back pocket my knees were hard up against the seat in front and I do not have long legs.  We were told by a flight attendant that there was a ""technical problem"". After an hour or so they came round with drinks. After two hours they were looking like they might bring more drinks but we overheard two flight attendants talking and they said it couldn't be fixed. A few minutes past two hours late they decided the aircraft was fixed. All they said was that there was a bad sensor. Something near three hours after we boarded the aircraft we finally pushed back and started up. One drink in three hours doesn't seem like they met their obligation in the USA to feed and water us when delays exceed two hours. After departure they finally fed us. I had requested a dairy free meal. What a disaster. Basically it was vegan, but vegan with zero imagination. Mostly dry pasta with some tasteless veg on top. The sweet was an oily cake. Awful food. I had to walk around several times to deal with the pain in my knees from tight seats. Other than that the flight was uneventful, just uncomfortable and unpalatable. The entertainment was nothing to brag about.",Aer Lingus,A330-200,2,

The food was terrible but worse were the seats. The aisles are so small that you must carry your purse in front of you. It won't fit on the side. Space between the rows is so small that when the person in front leans back, you cannot move at all. My husband is tall and was so miserable, but I am very small and I had to crawl out of my seat.  We paid a great deal for these economy seats and literally could not walk after we arrived in Dublin. Leaving Dublin was even worse. There is one line for all passengers, no matter which AerLingus flight they are on. We were in line for 1.5 hours before we had to go to the line for security - which is done twice. It took 3 hours to get to our flight. By the way, there is a sign that suggests you bring your bags the night before to the airport.

Airport check in was quick and easy and the business class/gold circle lounge offered a good choice of drinks with some snacks and had good wi-fi connectivity. About 90 minutes before departure we were invited to clear US immigration and customs in Dublin and boarding commenced about 45 minutes before departure. Once onboard the cabin was a big improvement over the previous version. I was seated in 3K which was very private and spacious. The seat was easy to adjust and offers a comfortable lie flat sleeping position (I'm 6ft1). There are plenty of stowages for small items adjacent to the seat as well as the overhead bins. The seat also offered a power outlet compatible with UK/US devices. IFE was good and offered a reasonable choice of on demand entertainment but was a bit short of new release movies. Business class passengers are offered complimentary wi-fi which worked well for the majority of the flight. The cabin service was professional and attentive and the inflight meal was good quality. Pre departure drinks were offered and after departure there was a canapés service followed by the main meal service. The crew were on hand for anything else throughout the flight and there was an afternoon tea service about an hour before landing. I had ordered a gluten free meal which was rather unimaginative but the standard meal options looked good.

The sealed duty free bag worked perfectly and me and my hand luggage were soon inside the Business Class lounge at Shannon, which is lovely - if lacking in food stuff - with delightful staff. Staff on the flight were friendly and Irish breakfast was soon on my tray table. The orange juice had a strange fizzy taste on drinking and sadly would appear that it was off.

Terminal 5 is well organised and went through Fast Track security. The new Gold Circle Lounge is around Gate 26 which is a bit of a trek away from the departure gates. Aer Lingus offer a dine before you board facility in the lounge, but it's not that bi, and the selection is not that great - the sandwich options were a better option. Boarding on time and we soon relaxed in seats 2F and 2D with a glass of champagne before take off. Two very nice crew looked after us on the flight which seemed busy - Business Class was full. The seats were different on this flight (an Aer Lingus branded plane it was a Boeing 757 operated by Air Contractors). There was no difference in crew service and quality of catering. After take off drinks and canapés offered which were great. The senior crew member in Business was polite and friendly and interacted well. Dinner with a choice of Herb Crusted Loin of Lamb, Roast Chicken Breast with Ricotta Cannelloni, and Roasted Cod with cabbage and fennel. This was followed by a cheese plate. My partner had the vegetarian meal which was stuffed ravioli and thoroughly enjoyed. PTV screen wasn't as big as the outward journey but selection of films and TV was around the same. The seat more or less was flat, and was comfortable enough to grab a cat nap. Breakfast was served around an hour from Shannon - fruit plate, Hot Irish Bacon Roll which was delicious, and coffee. A very pleasant experience that I would happily repeat.",Aer Lingus,Boeing 757,4,

Seems that they reduce the frequency on these busy routes in the Summer to deploy aircraft on seasonal routes. Schedules in Winter are much better and have just booked five flights for the next few months from Birmingham. Interestingly every one of them was cheaper than flights on same dates at similar times with Ryanair. I always fly Aer Lingus over Ryanair unless there is a huge difference in price. The aircraft are usually clean and trolleys well stocked. I say this because it seems on Ryanair they stock the trolleys in the morning and sell out on later flights. A benefit of flying Aer Lingus is you arrive and depart T2 Dublin. Aer Lingus has been marketing itself as a low cost airline, and they charge for food and drinks. Overall always happy with Aer Lingus.",Aer Lingus,A320,,

Adam Brown (United Kingdom) 27th August 2015",unk,Hadn't flown Aer Lingus for a while so was interested to see what the London to Dublin hop was like these days. As had an onward connection was given a Gold Circle Lounge pass - the lounge is well appointed in Terminal 2 and nicely decorated although found the food offerings slightly lacking. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes but we were kept updated and boarding was prompt and efficient. We were seated in 12E and F and sound the amount of legroom ok. The captain was keen to try and make up time so the service inflight was pretty rushed with the Bia trolleys not reaching all the passengers. Crew coped well though and were polite and friendly throughout. A nice flight that arrived in Dublin only 15 minutes late compared to the 30-40 minutes late departure from LHR.,Aer Lingus,,,

Adam Brown (United Kingdom) 27th August 2015",unk,"I hadn't travelled Aer Lingus Business Class for about 15 years and was looking forward to a trip down memory lane as I used to do the Dublin to JFK route regularly. The trip had been planned for ages, and I had checked and double checked the arrangements with the Airline about 4-5 times as I had booked through an agent and all seemed in order. Arrived Saturday morning and had a painless check in and bag drop and soon found ourselves in the T2 Business Class lounge which is nice and well appointed. The food offering is nowhere near as good as other lounges with limited cold stuff available. We were called to go through Immigration at 09.30 and the idea of doing this in Dublin rather face the queues at JFK is still pure genius. This was quick and efficient and couldn't be faulted and we were in the boarding area within 15 minutes before being called to Board the EI105 at 10.00. We were greeted by the Cabin Service Manager who showed us to our seats in 2H and 2K. Jackets were taken and we were offered a drink by the lovely Senior Cabin crew member who looked after us throughout the flight. Take off was on time. Shortly after take off we were offered drinks and a smal dish of canapés. I was a bit surprised that my Vegetarian partner was offered the fish ones, and at this stage we discovered that the many times confirmed Lacto Vegetarian meal had not been loaded. The crew said not to worry and they would sort something out. The lunch menu offered a choice of starters of Chicken Liver Pate or Burren Smokehouse hot and cold smoked salmon which is pictured. My partner was offered the cheese plate from the dessert offering. I had the Salmon which was great. Mains were a choice of Collar of Irish Bacon, Lambay Island Irish Lamb Stew or a Luxury Crisp fish pie - the crew recommended the bacon which is pictured and was delicious. At this point my partner was advised that the Vegetarian meal had been found (looked like in economy) and it was just the tray that was missing. He was served a Vegetarian pasta dish which he said was fine Dessert was a choice of Lemon Tart or Cheese Plate both of which wee good and there was a rather nice Sancerrre on offer with lunch which was also good This was the new style business class but it would appear that Aer Lingus has ditched the idea of dining on demand as this was not offered. The new seat is brilliant though a massive lie flat bed, that is really comfy, together with a big screen to enjoy a decent selection of television in demand, and free wifi for business class customers. There is also a selection of snacks in the galley now - crisps sandwiches fruit - that kind of thing. About an hour before landing we were served a rather odd Super Power Salad of quinoa, courgette and feta cheese which wasn't the tastiest thing I had ever had on a plane, but the scones that accompanied it were great. We landed in JFK at 13.15 and we were out of Terminal 5 and in Terminal 4 with bags at 13.35 which was absolutely superb. All in all, despite the meal mix up, this was an excellent Transatlantic crossing that left many other bigger airlines in the shade, and given the favourable price, one that I would happily recommend.",Aer Lingus,A330,4,4

No more. This short flight was enough to convince me that the Irish government was foolish in not allowing Ryanair to buy out the ""flag carrier"" and put it to its well-deserved death. Dublin Airport is one of the worst there is - long foot travel, very few conveniences, unhelpful staff, generally a frenzied dump of an airport, and this swaps over onto Aer Lingus, too. The former proud little airline hit hard times and sought to revive its fortunes as ""ultra low cost carrier"", thus taking on Ryanair head to head - what a stupid idea. Legroom is so tight. There is no inflight entertainment of any kind, the cabin was not fresh, and absolutely everything - from water on down, must be purchased from sometimes surly staff. British Airways has just bought Aer Lingus, possibly to establish its own low-cost brand, but I am hoping against the odds that they will actually invest and restore Aer Lingus to what it once was and used to be - a decent airline with happy employees and excellent service to and from Ireland.",Aer Lingus,A320,1,1

N Stapleton (Ireland) 19th August 2015",unk,Flew with Aer Lingus Regional operated by Stobart Air from Dublin to Manchester. At Dublin Airport boarding was efficient and relaxed even though we were bussed to a remote stand. The 70 seater ATR 72-600 is in a 2-2 seating configuration so I found the smaller aircraft more relaxing than an A320 or B738. The aircraft was modern (2 years old) and clean. Seat comfort and legroom were reasonable enough. Drinks and snacks were sold on this flight even though it was very short. The two cabin crew members were very friendly. The flight arrived on time in Manchester and we were bussed to Terminal 1.

The best inflight food I've head in a while to be honest. Although it's not free, it is reasonably priced.

Inflight entertainment was pretty good. Meals were not so good and beverage service was below standard. Had issues with passenger behind us that allowed their child to continuously kick the back of our seat. We asked the mother once of the problem yet the child continued. Asked again to please have your child stop the kicking. Third time was enough and flight crew intervened and helped settle the problem. A cookie for the kicking child and a glass of wine for us. Very odd situation but handled OK by crew. Overall the flight seemed short handed, stressed and just did not want to do their job. Return flight back was like night and day. Our baggage was well above the limit but nothing was said and they checked us in with no questions. Both flights were on time. Ground staff friendly and helpful, cabin crew were friendly, helpful and outgoing. Meals were actually tasty and there were non-stop beverage runs. The crew came across happy and willing to please the passengers. I got on the plane dreading the flight but departed with a positive attitude. Seating is tight though. I recommend Aer Lingus as an alternative airlines if you are looking for a budget alternative to flying.",Aer Lingus,A330,4,

The first leg of this trip, JFK-SNN, was operated by Air Contractors (I actually think this was the best flight out of the 4). The Boeing 757 cabin was clean. There were pillows and blankets on each seat. The IFE was sufficient for a ~5 hour flight. There was a meal 1-1.5 hours after takeoff (Chicken or Beef). It was okay and what one would expect of an airline meal. SNN-LHR and FCO-DUB were on A320s. The planes were clean but the seats were a little bit tight. There were no IFE on both flights and they charged for food and beverage. DUB-JFK on an A330 dual aisle plane. No pillow and blanket at my seat but they had blankets available for the passengers. The IFE was again sufficient for 7 hour flight. There was a meal after takeoff and a light snack before landing. The boarding process on all 4 flights were effective and all 4 flights left on time. The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. The check in staff at FCO T1 was not but can't really fault them on that.",Aer Lingus,,4,

There went our prepaid extra legroom seats no air controls no Aer Lingus staff no individual seat TVs nothing - it was horrible and the worst part - no prior notice. Then - coming back Aer Lingus Shannon - Boston May 31 flight 135 - supposed to be a double aisle aircraft - you guessed it - Boeing 757 - one aisle - 6 hours and no explanations. Yes I understand the airlines can substitute aircraft - but (especially on flight 138) a comparable and comfortable substitute should have been made. I was appalled (and I am a regular traveler to Ireland).,Aer Lingus,,1,

I last traveled on Aer Lingus in 1977 as a child. The service was excellent and the food was great. So when I booked our trip in May 2015 to Italy through Dublin to Naples I was excited. I could not have been more disappointed. The service was terrible. There was only 1 flight attendant that gave a faint smile (and that was on all legs of the trip. A British staff member was on board for the final Dublin to Boston flight via Titan Airlines. They were a breath of fresh air and were very pleasant and actually smiled). The food was bad. The plane was pretty clean though. This was the cheapest airline I have flown on. They kept charging for everything. On the flight from Dublin to Naples they charged for every single thing even water. Not one thing was distributed for free. I could see if I paid very little for my flight but this was not a cheap rock bottom fare. Frankly I was ashamed of being Irish after I took the first leg of the trip. We were traveling with 10 other people and all agreed that they would have no interest in traveling to Ireland for a future vacation. So Aer Lingus - you might be saving a lot of money but you are obliterating anyone's desires to travel to Ireland in the future.,Aer Lingus,,1,

Went to book luggage in and was grabbed and asked if I wanted to be put on the earlier flight which was good. I had previously paid for a seat upfront but only got row 9 in the reorg which was odd as there were spare seats on the earlier flight. Bad news - loads of planes leaving at that time so really only gained about half an hour but hey not their fault. Usual problem though - people with too much luggage and no idea of how to stow on board. They did weigh some and grab some but I feel they need to monitor this when people get on the plane as some people really are quite selfish and clueless. Also Aer Lingus passengers take forever getting on or off a plane which actually does matter if you have trains and buses to get. However cheaper than Ryanair and quite pleasant.,Aer Lingus,,,

From the start we were greeted with disinterested and unfriendly staff at check in. Even though I checked in with my husband we were not seated next to each other even though the plane wasn't full. I moved myself over to sit with him before take off but why would they seat us apart? The cabin crew were miserable. Finally they rush through with the tea and coffee and snacks that you have to purchase and staff didn't even bother to ask us if we would like something. The plane itself was disgustingly dirty with drink stains spilled on the seat. The back of the seats holding the magazines was vile with what looked like a mixture of spilt drink food and mould. We will never fly Aer Lingus again.,Aer Lingus,,,

The experience at Munich airport was very poor particularly the passport control line which was 45 minutes of unrestrained and uncontrolled pushing and shoving. Probably not Aer Lingus' fault but still a poor start. I had paid for a business class ticket over the internet. Did not find out until getting on the plane that the first part of the trip (Munich to Dublin) was economy as there are no business class seats on the plane. Typical economy experience. The actual business class portion of the trip (Dublin to Boston) was excellent. However the fare (which looked reasonable initially) in retrospect seemed far too high given that 3 hours of the 9 hour trip were actually not business class. I had a medical issue that caused me to book the business class ticket so I was really horrified at the unexpected 3 hours in economy which I had bought the business class ticket specifically to avoid.,Aer Lingus,,,

The urge to throw-up a feeling not welcomed by most especially not at 30000+ altitude was overwhelming and a sense of unwanted panic set in. Luckily I was accompanied by my boyfriend whom along with the diligent and empathetic flight crew got me back on track for the remainder of the flight.

Late boarding apparently due to inbound plane being late which is odd as it arrived on time. Then the most ridiculous shambles of boarding that took forever. If people have paid for seats then they should get on first especially as some people are greedy with hand luggage and seem incapable of stowing it correctly. Finally after a good wait I got to get on the plane to find the lady on my row had blocked an entire area by putting her case in the wrong way round! Why is this not monitored? Its about time this boarding procedure was improved upon. Its the same old story. If its a full plane supervise them and get people to board both front and back!,Aer Lingus,,,

There was a problem with the system and my seat was given away to someone else. I asked then for a window seat and this was not given.

Very slow check-in with a huge queue. More importantly I can't understand why Aer Lingus make you check-in in Terminal Three and then make you walk the whole way back to Terminal one to board plane to Dublin - this is a long trudge from Terminal three through terminal two to terminal one. You would need a up to an hour to do this walk. (including long security check line). When you fly into Rome you go into terminal one and can exit there. When we finally got to gate the staff insisted on taking carry-on bags from some people (but not all) because the flight was full. In the end the overhead lockers were half empty but some people had a long wait for their luggage. Aer Lingus need to improve their ground facilities in Rome and move the check in desk to terminal one adjacent to the gate.,Aer Lingus,,,

Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Ground staff at Heathrow should improve their skills. She asked me to check-in my big suitcase at the boarding gate because she could not print the luggage tag for me - it was too late. I went back to the check-in counter at the time she announced. Finally I was stopped by security due to the liquid in my big suitcase. I missed the flight and I was o/b the next flight.,Aer Lingus,,,

What a bunch of cold flight attendants. I have never experienced anything like it. A smile must cost them a million or cause them a lot of pain. Maybe it's these ugly uniforms. The service is minimal with one meal on a transatlantic flight and most of the flight you could not find the flight attendants other than in the galley. I have also never experienced a flight with so many passengers with bladder problems. Of course they don't go to the airport bathrooms to them it is much nicer to go in the plane so minutes after take-off they start to go and go and go. Make sure you sit far away from the bathrooms or better yet fly a better airline.,Aer Lingus,,1,

Check in all ok at the airport but once on the plane the partner of the man seated next to me in row 2 made a huge fuss about my son (who was sitting quietly and minding his own business) being in the cabin to which the female crew member replied 'I agree but there's nothing I can do about it'. The other male crew member was 'too busy' to bring an infant lap belt once the doors had closed and I was offered neither a drink or a meal. Really poor service added to an outdated seat I wouldn't recommend Aer Lingus.,Aer Lingus,,,

The staff checked in all but 9 of us who happened to be from yesterday's cancelled flight. A long time later they managed a flight to London Heathrow tonight with Air Canada boarding at 10.40 pm. I'm going to arrive in Heathrow at 11am and board an Aer Lingus flight for Dublin arriving at 2.45 tomorrow. I'm really not sure what to do when travel goes pear-shaped but Aer Lingus oversold the flights and nine of us unrelated and obviously not aggressive or over-assertive ended up in a horrendous nightmare.

However one major concern from the end of March '15 the 06.50 flight will cease to operate and the first flight of the day to Dublin will be at 09.10 which is useless for those of us going to work in Dublin.,Aer Lingus,,,
1471,,Economy Class,,,no,3,4,3,,3,4,Aer Lingus customer review,C Lynch (United Kingdom) 20th March 2015,unk,Flew Dublin Boston with 3 month old two year old and husband. Having informed infant travelling and confirmed bassinet seat boarded plane to be told sorry not bassinet row after all. Plane change the previous evening and row numbering differed with new aircraft and bassinet rows were not allocated appropriately for new aircraft. We were lucky that kind passengers (with no accompanying infants) eventually gave up their bassinet row seats. Contacted Aer Lingus before the return leg of the journey to request bassinet row for the journey home - customer service response was poor in relation to the matter. When we checked in on flight home and we requested to be sat together if possible we were informed there were four children travelling in bassinet seats and my husband would have to sit in row behind me (my 3 month old) and my two year old. We were fine with this as we understood priority to be given to adults with accompanying infants but once we boarded flight it became obvious one bassinet row occupied by 2 infants (our row) and the other bassinet row given to adults with no accompanying infants. It would have made our trip home a little easier to have been seated together as anyone with children knows. We travelled from the UK to Dublin to support Irish company but we will not fly with Aer Lingus again. Previous travel for us with British Airways to US was predictable and turned out to be superior. It is a pity.,Aer Lingus,,3,

1474,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,5,5,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,G Rowand (United States) 4th March 2015,unk,Overall surprisingly a great experience - emphasis on the surprise. Flying Boston to Edinburgh with a layover in Dublin. Checked in online was almost immediately sent an email and text informing me my flight was delayed 40 minutes. Arrive at the airport and am continuously informed of further delays. The plane was late getting in and they flipped it as quickly as they could somehow managing to get fresh blankets and pillows in every seat although they did not have time to get fresh headsets on board before takeoff. By the time we got off the ground we were 2 hours behind schedule. Despite this we were informed that we would only be half an hour behind schedule due to favorable weather. This was not the case we were over an hour late. Upon arrival in Dublin almost everyone on the plane were given tickets for new flights since literally all of us missed our connections due to the delays. I was booked on the next flight out of Dublin (which was still a 5 hour wait) and given vouchers in 5 euro increments for breakfast as compensation for the inconvenience. Everyone with whom I spoke during the delay the confusion and the ticket transferring was absolutely a joy seriously one of the best customer service experiences I have had while flying. The food on the flight was great for airline food and in the course of a 5 hour flight we were given a beverage and snack service dinner coffee/tea and morning juice. For the price you really just can't beat it.,Aer Lingus,,4,

The pre US clearance actually makes the flights more confusing as you have to give yourself over 2 hours to clear that area then find the appropriate gate. This is NOT printed on your boarding card and the distances in this airport are lengthy. Business class desk woman was extremely rude and so were the 2 customer service desk attendees that I dealt with to change my flight. Internet has never worked on these flights for me my vegetarian requests have been missed 4 out of 5 times and the general level of Irish customer service is extremely low. They speak to you as if it is a privilege to pay them to fly with them. Do not fly with Aer Lingus if you need to ask a representative for anything. They are understaffed and the employees are not helpful in general. Fend for yourself with this cheap airline.,Aer Lingus,,1,

Boarded first and welcomed with a glass of champagne. Crew chatty and attentive. Lovely meal and a few hours sleep on the near flat beds. I understand this year they will move to fully flat. Arrive in JFK as a domestic passenger so seamless to public transport or a cab. Flying back was excellent too. Slept most of the flight. Crew in good spirits but not as good as the crew out on the 17th (4pm flight). Overall top marks.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1477,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,Ian Gallagher (Ireland) 26th January 2015,unk,SNN-BOS: I booked the flight on the Aer Lingus website and the cost was very reasonable. Check in was quick and efficient in less than 5 minutes same with security and US Immigration which is a real bonus. The flight was operated by Air Contractors for Aer Lingus 757 which is a smaller aircraft to the traditional A330 Aer lingus used to use on the route. I chose to sit in the back cabin of the aircraft as most people were sitting up at the front and the middle of the aircraft the few of us at the back had a row of three seats each. The seat pitch was fine (and mush better compared to the Qantas A380 which I was on two weeks prior). The pre order meal is well worth the extra money especially for the west bound flight it includes wine and has proper cutlery and is served on porcelain and the meal is served individually before the standard meals. In-flight entertainment was touch screen (there was no remote and the head sets is plugged into the side of the screen) with a good choice of movies: there are some new releases and a good few classic movies with the usual array of sitcoms music and the in-flight map. Crew were friendly and professional throughout the flight chatting with the passengers throughout the service. There was a small snack of a large flapjack with tea or coffee before landing. Overall a good service comfortable aircraft (despite the smaller size of the 757 there was a nice area near the aft restrooms to stretch your legs) good seat pitch (I am 6 ft) and it is well worth upgrading your meal.,Aer Lingus,,4,

However the aircraft was old grubby and very tired looking it seems to be used on ""leisure"" destinations (a bit like the old charter style operations) the seat pitch is definitely narrower than their other aircraft and there was no seat pockets I'm accustomed to not having them on Ryanair and don't mind but on a 4 hour flight it's awkward. Ordered pre-order meals - they were ok I'm still not a fan of Clodagh McKennas inflight menu but it filled the gap. Unless you are in the 1st 3 rows they don't generally have much left when they come around. As I had booked wheelchair assistance for my mother I wasn't surprised that on arrival Swissport who do the handling do not have any lifts to take the passengers off the flight this is a regular occurrence at Agadir out of Aer LIngus's remit I reckon.

I have to say I was pretty disappointed. It may be a good service to those who haven't flown other airlines long haul. I found the seats cramped and uncomfortable. The PTV touchscreen was very unresponsive. They went around and gave one measly plastic cup of soft drink and advised those who wanted to ""buy"" wine for dinner they better do so now. Dinner arrived around an hour later (way too late as on a night flight everyone wants to get some sleep). By the time dinner came everyone had obviously finished their drinks and couldn't get another one with their dinner. The cabin crew didn't look too happy. When dinner was handed out and rubbish collected they disappeared for the rest of the flight. No water nothing. In comparison I flew Delta out and they were miles better complimentary wine with dinner (and a second and third if you wanted it). They came around with free drinks very soon after take off and dinner promptly after that. They served drinks with dinner and were very attentive throughout the rest of the flight handing out refreshments. They were also very friendly. I will not fly Aer Lingus transatlantic anymore when there are much better options.

After 2 very enjoyable weeks in Ireland travelled Dublin to Edinburgh with a party of 20 on Aer Lingus. 16 had an extra bag booked and all those were well underweight. One person had an extra bag not overweight but not booked for which the additional charge was 320 euros. This was negotiated down to 270 euros and we were advised that the charge would have been wiped had we flown into Ireland using Aer Lingus. To put the extra charge in perspective the price of a return ticket plus bag on the net that day was 119 euros.

Food was pretty bad mostly tasteless slop for the main meal and an insulting muffin and coffee/tea for ""afternoon tea"" which was literally thrown at some people. We could watch movies/TV free but the headset quality was atrocious we couldn't hear clearly (same for announcements which could be a safety hazard). I switched to my own headset so I can confirm that this was an airline problem. Attendants were inattentive - on the night time outbound trip they disappeared so no water could be had overnight (there was no-one at the back of the plane). They were also curt and unsmiling - except when I tried to board when they stopped the passengers immediately ahead of me and went into a whole ""Irish"" routine which went on for a while.

1487,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,4,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,R Singletary (United Kingdom) 10th December 2014,unk,LHR-DUB-LGW was pretty good both ways with the outbound being delayed and inbound arriving early. Flight staff were always very nice and welcoming. Since this was a short flight the low-cost carrier side of the airline revealed itself quite a bit. Didn't experience any problems and would definitely fly with them again.,Aer Lingus,,,
1488,,Economy Class,,,no,3,4,,,2,6,Aer Lingus customer review,Zafrullah Hamzah (Ireland) 10th December 2014,unk,Dublin to Paris CDG return. I paid for a flexible ticket which costs more than twice the ordinary fare. By right this should be equivalent to business class fare. However Aer Lingus operates an economy only seating on this route. It used to include 2 checked bangs of 20 kgs each. Not anymore as you only get one 20kg bag now. With this fare you get lounge access but you still have to purchase food and drinks on the plane. Outbound flight was largely ok. On the return trip I was very annoyed to discover that the overhead bin was full and as I was on seat 1C there was no front seat I could put my small carry on luggage under. Eventually the stewardess managed to squeeze it in an overhead bin above the seat behind. I find this unacceptable as obviously no proper checks were carried out allowing people to carry disproportionately more stuff on board and thus depriving others from getting their fare share of space. It irritated me even more that I had paid over the odds to discover that there was no space for my small carry on luggage above my seat. I have to agree with strict policies regarding carry on luggage as is with Ryanair. I guess I will still continue flying Aer Lingus as there are not too many options on this route but Aer Lingus should probably have a small business class cabin so that those who pay more get that bit more for the extra they fork out for their ticket. Alas I am unlikely to see this in my lifetime. In summary I think the worst thing an airline can do is combining a low cost approach while still charging extra for which you don't get much more. If Aer Lingus wants to be a real low cost airline that's fine but don't charge more and give nothing much in return.,Aer Lingus,,,
1489,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,5,9,Aer Lingus customer review,J German (Spain) 25th November 2014,unk,I recently flew Aer Lingus from Malaga to Dublin and then on to San Francisco again with Aer Lingus from Dublin the following day. I have never flown with Aer Lingus before but cannot fault either the flights or their customer service. We booked the enhanced meals on our return flights from Dublin to San Francisco and my only comment would be that although the outgoing meals were superb the incoming meals appeared to have been a little overcooked. Without exception all flights left on time and arrived early.,Aer Lingus,,4,
1490,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,D O'Connor (Ireland) 12th November 2014,unk,Flew EI111. Service I will admit was bad. I fly maybe 4 times a year with Aer Lingus on its European network and some people need to remember that we sadly have left the era of luxury air travel like the Great Swissair. Even flag carriers now have to cut costs. What you pay for on Aer Lingus is very cheap for the service compared to another low cost Irish airline.,Aer Lingus,,4,
1491,,Economy Class,,,no,2,3,2,,3,2,Aer Lingus customer review,B Ellis (United Kingdom) 31st October 2014,unk,We travelled Newcastle-Dublin-Chicago early October and chose Aer Lingus because of the option to do Immigration in Dublin. What a disappointment. At US Immigration in Dublin we were handed Customs Forms. The guy handing them out had no idea what they were for or who had to fill them in. The Immigration process however was fairly straightforward and much quicker than we've experienced in the US. Once on board what a disappointment. We waited almost two hours before the flight attendants came around with the drinks trolley. They only came around once in an eight hour flight. And we had to pay for the drinks. This is the first time we've had to do this on a Transatlantic flight. They never came around with complimentary water or juice. I asked the attendant for some water which she brought to me but when the lady in front asked for water she was told they'd stopped serving drinks!! Lunch was pretty grim and afternoon tea was a flapjack - pretty hard to swallow when you're thirsty! On a positive note when we landed in Chicago we collected our luggage and were on our way pretty quickly. The return overnight flight was no better then our flight from Dublin to Newcastle was delayed because of an incident in Dublin airport. We were sitting in a very cold aircraft for over an hour. The pilot said he would start the engines to warm the plane up - the propellors turned twice! When we got home I had a query and needed to speak to Customer Service. I filled in a Customer Service form - 4 weeks later I'm still waiting for a response.,Aer Lingus,,3,

The views and ambience is far superior to the old T1 lounge but the food is still pretty pathetic the exception being the coffee - there is a machine as well as a percolator. The flight was fine with one exception the seat pitch was incredibly tight. This is a refurbished plane with the magazine rack at eye level.

1493,,Business Class,,,yes,4,5,5,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,Norman Lezotte (United States) 31st October 2014,unk,October 16. Business Class Orlando to Dublin and economy class connecting to Amsterdam. It is difficult to fault this airline. The quality and attitude of the flight attendants is remarkable. This was true even on the connecting economy flight to Amsterdam despite the seating being very tight and the flight was packed. Flights departed and left on time. Boarding was more chaotic as patrons waited while families with infants and those in wheelchairs boarded early but brought with them large extended families as well to take advantage of the early boarding. October 25 the return flight from Amsterdam only allows check in with KLM but Aer Lingus passengers find out too late that they cannot print boarding passes from the hotel but only at blue KLM machines in the airport. On return to Orlando in the time it took to walk for the gate to baggage Aer Lingus already had the bags on the conveyor belt. Now that's a first.,Aer Lingus,,4,
1494,,Economy Class,,,no,1,5,1,,1,unk,Aer Lingus customer review,Joan Doherty (United Kingdom) 31st October 2014,unk,For an international carrier it must rate as the poorest value. The audacity of them to charge for alcoholic beverages and the gall of them to recommend you spend €18 odd on what they call a decent meal when most national carriers provide the same free. I was travelling with some friends from Australia and they were taken aback by the frugality of the meals and beverages. Not my favourite airline and would only travel with them if it was absolutely necessary. As the Irish have a habit of mimicking every other country don't know why they cannot take this on board.,Aer Lingus,,4,

I am fed up with the Aer Lingus bashing on this site. Whilst conceding that I am Irish and could be accused of bias on the number of occasions over the last few years I have flown with Aer Lingus I can truthfully say that the overall service has been outstanding. Flight delays are usually outside the control of the airline. The crews without exception have been warm friendly and totally professional. I have enjoyed flying with Aer Lingus and look forward to doing so again.,Aer Lingus,,,
1496,,Business Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,4,7,Aer Lingus customer review,S Alabere (United Kingdom) 28th October 2014,unk,"Flew CWL-DUB-JFK and YYZ-DUB-CWL business class. Had the opportunity to bid for upgrade which we did and was accepted. The flight from CWL was on Stobart Air new plane and surprisingly quite a bit of leg room and seat comfort. We chose this route so we could clear immigration in DUB which was very easy to do and then sit in the BC lounge until ready to fly. The trip over was great comfortable seats which laid flat wi-fi 5 course meal on real plates and a tasty snack before we landed. The cabin crew were delightful nothing was too much trouble. The IFE was ok I mainly listened to music which had some great artists on there and some relatively new releases. I did not watch a film as I was too busy playing email tag with friends taking advantage of the wi-fi. Arrived at JFK on time and breezed through the terminal to collect luggage and to meet our waiting transfer. Return journey YYZ-DUB-CWL. Business lounge in YYZ airport is run by KLM massive lounge with great selection of food and drinks. The return plane was a different configuration and older so BC was not as comfortable in my opinion. There were only 12 seats and 2 were empty we were in row 1 and the screen for the IFE was so far away I could barely see it. One member of staff to care for our needs she was rather offhand and sourfaced not like that smilers we had coming over. Dinner was served it was ok but not to the standard of the outward flight and the seats were not as comfortable due to the fact that when you did use the recline/lie flat you were placed at an angle that made you feel as if you were about to slide on the floor. During the flight I asked for a cup of coffee (I dont sleep) and she said I will be serving breakfast in 30 minutes would you like yours now I said no just the coffee. When she served breakfast she did not give me mine so had to ask when she replied ""oh you said you did not want breakfast"". When we arrived at DUB we had to go through security again despite having just gotten off a plane and only being in transit. Due to the plane being slightly late we only had 15mins to get to our gate. Our bags were scrutinised and my friends duty free was checked to see if the seal had been broken and the receipt matched with the label. Very irritating we did end up being slightly late to our gate (we had our boarding passes) but it was stress we could have done without. The flight back to CWL was with Stobart Air packed but no problems. All in all not bad for the price we paid as the outward journey balanced the return.",Aer Lingus,,4,

The food was good the entertainment was good and the leg room on the flights was great. Only issue I did have was from Amsterdam to Dublin because we arrived 30 minutes left and nearly missed our connecting flight from Dublin to O'Hare however we made it on time with all of our belongings.

Flights departed and arrived on time and were relatively smooth. Transit through Kerry and Dublin airports (with no luggage) was easy. The aircraft was uncomfortably hot during the early morning flight from Kerry. Food was dreadful - a rock hard scone from 'Clodagh's Kitchen'. Not Clodagh's best bake! These are relatively minor though easily resolved quibbles in what is a very useful service.,Aer Lingus,,,
1499,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,4,3,,5,9,Aer Lingus customer review,B Phillips (United Kingdom) 22nd October 2014,unk,Used the BHX-DUB flight taking about an hour and just wanted to say what a pleasant experience it was compared to the competition on this route. No check-in queue or problems even though I was late due to a delayed train. A relaxed and pleasant experience throughout. No being herded onto stairwells so that the airline can stick to its tight schedules - just walked straight onto the plane after a short wait. The plane itself was a newish ATR 72-600 with an easy-on-the-eye light grey/blue interior - not the oppressive yellow and blue of the competition. Also no jarring announcements or being pestered to buy scratch cards. National carriers are also often a small window on the country to which you are travelling so it was nice to have staff that were actually Irish. Terminal 2 in Dublin is also much easier than T1. A relaxing experience and good all round - well worth the extra few euros (although actually cheaper than FR for this particular trip).,Aer Lingus,,1,

The flight was delayed on the way out although it was confirmed that this was due to the airport the plane was leaving to come to Belfast to pick us up and in the end it was only just over an hour due to a speedy turn around by Aer Lingus staff. The aircraft was clean and tidy and not at all tired looking a good job especially given the short turnaround time that staff had. Flight was comfortable with a decent enough level of leg room although the cabin did feel a little hot on both out and inbound flights. The food selection was decent and of a standard a little higher than I would have normally expected although perhaps in the grander scheme of things like most airlines a little pedestrian. The return flight was much the same no problems and nothing to further stress my wife and I while travelling with our toddler for her first time on a plane. Also a few days after landing I contacted Aer Lingus as we seemed to have misplaced a new pair of shoes we had bought in Palma airport for our daughter. Usually some airlines are impossible to deal with after the fact however Aer Lingus were helpful and really gave the impression they went the extra mile to see if they could locate our misplaced shoes.,Aer Lingus,,,

1505,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,A Clarke (Ireland) 5th October 2014,unk,Two flights the first EI 564 DUB-BCN and the other EI 739 PMI-DUB. The first took off late due to the late arrival of the aircraft which was the truth (refreshingly) as the aircraft only arrived 20mins before we were due to depart but the time was made up with a fairly quick two hour flight to BCN. Not a full flight so we had space to move and didn't have the usual cabin baggage issues. Took the cabin crew a while to get going with inflight service but they had everything we asked for. The crew were nice if a little robotic. Plane wasn't spotless but they were in a hurry to go again so understandable (it wasn't filthy either). The flight back was packed and the airport in Palma is awful one of the warmest airports I've set foot in. The usual issues with pax and their cabin baggage while this is not the fault of the crew it should be dealt with or pax should know how to stow their luggage efficiently. It seems to rather aggravate the cabin crew that they are reduced to baggage handlers and rightly too. Otherwise there were similar crew-bots to the ones on the way over. Did everything by the book and kept the lights low for anyone who wanted to sleep. As per usual the bags took an age to arrive and this seems to be quite a regular occurrence now. But as an experience but flights were absolutely fine and pretty good value for money.,Aer Lingus,,,
1506,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,5,3,,3,unk,Aer Lingus customer review,Jackson David (Spain) 5th October 2014,unk,Booking experience is horrific. We've flown with this airline 8 times this year and each time there are many mistakes in the booking process. Their website is worse than useless it throws a litany of errors and seemingly holding parts of your information input which confounds the website next time you access it. This last booking it lost seat reservations and despite many emails are unable to get a simple request like sitting together right. They charge for meals and don't provide them. Onboard all is well nice friendly staff on clean planes. Food is just acceptable. Best way is take your own and have a picnic. All our flights have been on time. Avoiding massive queues on arrival in US having immigration in Dublin makes flying to the US better than any other route. Advice? Book early and be prepared for a slow process.,Aer Lingus,,4,

Didn't book a seat on this occasion so ended up in row ten which is noticeably smaller than the first 5 rows. Unbelievably the woman in front reclined her seat (its a short flight) and reduced my space even further. Plane more or less on time however landed at terminal one and walked miles to terminal 2 - no logic. 21st September Sunday flight - Queuing had been slightly addressed but loading was held back because of there only being one member of staff instead of two checking in and people just being slow. Arrived late which led to a few people having to run the length of Gatwick to get to their trains. Its about time Aer Lingus loaded people from the front and back of the planes.,Aer Lingus,,,

We took Aer Lingus 757 contracted by Air Contractors. The price was right but you get what you pay for. The food was worse than TV dinners the stewardesses were so unfriendly (on both flights) and the TV's did not work on the flight back so we could not watch movies.

Both flights were the worst that my wife and I have experienced. The flight attendants were rude inefficient unprofessional inattentive and were completely aloof to what was going on around them. For example I pushed our flight attendant buzzer at least 10 different times to no avail. We were completed ignored. The food service was a farce and disgrace. One passenger wanted a blanket asked for a blanket but never received one. Another passenger asked for a cup of tea several times and after 30 mins or so it finally arrived. At times you could not even find a flight attendant. We will probably never fly Aer Lingus again.,Aer Lingus,,3,

The seats do not recline fully and you are in close proximity to your seatmate. The food is coach class. Do not sit in first row as the attendants go in and out of galley but always fail to close the curtain when they go in and out. Returning to Florida and had to go through JFK and connect to JetBlue who does not have business class so you are in the way back in coach . You can pay extra for a seat closer to the front with extra leg room but of course Aer Lingus does not arrange that. Basically paying for 3/4 business class.,Aer Lingus,,3,

Ordinarily I would hate such flights but the price and nature of the Aer Lingus flight was exceptional the cabin crew were dedicated and tended to my every need providing a friendly a fun flight to New York. The seats were very comfortable and I was greeted with champagne upon arrival the inflight entertainment was highly varied with some real classic films as well as many block buster movies and TV shows. The flight departed on time. The only slight drawback currently is the fact the seats do not lie completely flat that being said you still have more than enough room to relax. When I raised this with staff they discussed how their will apparently soon be changes made to put in place those seats that do lie completely flat as other airlines have begun to put them into place. Overall the flight was incredibly relaxing and I would book long haul with Aer Lingus in a heartbeat for flying out of Dublin the service is exceptional and business class was an unforgettable experience.,Aer Lingus,,5,

The return trip from Dublin to Boston was not what we usually experience with Aer Lingus. The flight attendants were not helpful. They were slow distributing the snack which turned out to be only drinks didn't offer anyone a snack. They did not hand out blankets. Told passengers to get them themselves. Distributed the meal slowly and it was well into the flight before we ate. Ran out of choices so we got stuck with a beef meal that was inedible. The flight encountered some turbulence so seat belt naturally went on. Yet the pilot took his time turning that sign off when the turbulence cleared. It seemed like we were confined to our seats for most of the trip. That also seemed to make the attendants happy. They did not appear to enjoy their job at all that flight!,Aer Lingus,,4,

This flight was strictly ok and seemed like one of cheap airlines. It was a short flight but the passengers were very loud noisy but our connecting flight from Dublin to SFO Flt EI147 was a nightmare. After two security checks and a very slow US immigration Customs we went to the gate and the flight was delayed 90 minutes. Once on the plane it was freezing cold and there were no blankets on the seats for passengers. Cabin crew kept saying the heat would start soon but that never happened. We were travelling with kids and they were shivering. After repeatedly complaining the staff gave us some extra blankets which helped a little bit. We had ordered Hindu Vegetarian meals but we were given meals with chicken as they had no veggie meals onboard and nobody was apologetic. On this long flight we were given only one tasteless meal that the kids hardly ate and one snack bar before landing. No snacks or treats for kids during the flight. Vowed never to fly Aer-Lingus again.,Aer Lingus,,3,

By far a more preferable experience to that offered by Ryanair: no check in queue pleasant staff on-time boarding and departure and arrival into the new Terminal 2 at Dublin airport. Bags also delivered rapidly at both ends. On-board the (brand new) ATR aircraft the seats were comfortable and spacious. A bar and snack service (for cash) was offered. The only slight niggle was the ridiculously long Aer Lingus check in queue on the return home (Sunday evening). 50 minutes from start to finish. They do have a 'late check-in' desk and regularly have to announce flights that are closing and direct people to this desk to avoid missing flights!,Aer Lingus,,,
1522,,Economy Class,,,no,2,4,2,,2,3,Aer Lingus customer review,R Sampath (United States) 26th August 2014,unk,We flew Aer Lingus for our trip to Europe. We are a family of 4 with extensive travel experience. The tickets were not very cheap to begin with. We wanted to fly into London and fly out of Paris. For this the fare difference between Aer Lingus and Virgin British Airways was about $25-40 per person. Having flown with them I have now decided it would have been better to have flown with BA or Virgin. The flight from SFO to DUB and back is a long haul flight. On this flight we were offered one meal and one breakfast bar. The staff don't ask for Water or any other beverage from time to time. I saw other passengers bringing their own food drink etc.. They are probably used to traveling on this airline and are adequately prepared. The quality of entertainment is poor and the system they use is slow to respond. From time to time it hangs and we had to ask the crew to reboot the system. I guess we have been used to superior service from BA Singapore Airlines Cathay Air New Zealand and were disappointed even though the difference pricewise was not much. Speaking for myself and family we will not fly Aer Lingus again even if they offer a cheaper price.,Aer Lingus,,2,

Flight left at 7.30am about 6-7 drunken young men allowed to board. One fellow spent the whole 3 hours of the flight yelling back and forth to his buddies swearing every second word it seemed and there were small children sitting right in front of him. Everyone around very uncomfortable. Three hours of drunken louts around us and staff incapable of dealing with them they continued to serve them alcohol. He wasn't met at the arrival gate by security like he would have been in most places. After the horrible flight our luggage did arrive but it did take almost an hour to arrive at luggage collection so not sure if that was Aer Lingus or airports fault. No onboard flight entertainment (3 hour flight would have been nice) and food was all to be paid for but that's ok since it wasn't a long flight. Flight was cheap so would recommend airline for that reason only. But the other low cost airlines we flew on were all cheap too and better.,Aer Lingus,,1,
1524,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,Nigel Bennett (United Kingdom) 26th August 2014,unk,My wife daughter and I travelled from Gatwick to Chicago via Dublin on 23rd July. The flight to Dublin had 'no frills' but was more comfortable than a recent flight on another Irish budget airline. The 3 hours transfer time at Dublin was partially taken up with clearing US immigration and the rest with sitting waiting for the on time flight to Chicago. The cabin crew were mature and efficient and the meal was very acceptable and served two hours into the flight. When we arrived on time in Chicago because all the paperwork had been done we were able to walk out of the airport without hassle after collecting our baggage. The return flight on 14th August had a younger cabin crew who provided a more lively friendly but equally efficient service. The Beef meal was very tasty and the cheese and ham croissant just before landing was welcome. A word of warning during the transfer at Dublin outbound and inbound further scanning was carried out on our hand baggage. The duty free bottle was accepted as the seal on the bag had not been broken and we had the receipt but a small bottle of wine from the aircraft which I had kept to drink later was confiscated even though it was unopened. I had read some of the 'horror reviews before flying but our experience did not match them and we would happily fly with the Aer Lingus again. The moderate inconvenience of transferring in Dublin was worth it to save at least £200 pounds each on a direct flight.,Aer Lingus,,3,
1525,,Economy Class,,,no,3,2,,,3,2,Aer Lingus customer review,N Harvey (United Kingdom) 18th August 2014,unk,Sunday flight 19.00 17/8. I dread going home with Aer Lingus as there is usually a scrum to get on the plane as the regulars do not understand the meaning of the word queue and the staff don't control the amount of luggage each passenger takes onboard leading to the ritual scratching of heads when their oversized hand luggage doesn't fit in the overhead locker and delay as bags have to be stowed. Why does this continue? When eventually the passengers were on board (it takes forever as many cant count) we then had to listen to the captain boasting about how he was going to get us there early - of course he didn't. Cut the showing off - control the passengers hand luggage and teach them and the staff some manners. Far too expensive for this nonsense - get professional.,Aer Lingus,,,
1526,,Economy Class,,,no,1,4,1,,3,2,Aer Lingus customer review,C Macon (Ireland) 18th August 2014,unk,Firstly do not be tempted to sit in seats 31 E D F G or 29 A C H I on the Dublin to Boston route the Aer Lingus website will not show that these seats do not recline. I flew Aer Lingus DUB-BOS-DUB in August 2014. It has good staff reasonable planes and routes. But it is really badly let down by its archaic web site with no access to your booking or seat selection before check in tacky interiors with seat pockets hanging off cramped seats some the worst airplane food I have ever had the misfortune to eat. On my transatlantic flight I ended up sitting for 6 hours on the way out in a seat that didn't recline with the person in fronts seat wedged in my face. On the way back I was determined not to let this happen again so chose a middle aisle seat with apparently (on the online check-in website) had seats behind and in front However instead I got a lovely seat beside the toilet which didn't recline as there was a bulkhead behind not shown on their plan. Online check-in is worthless as you still have to queue up in Boston and your carefully printed ticket is torn up and binned. Overall the whole experience was so poor I would much rather go with an airline that actually wants to give passengers a reasonable experience even if it takes a few hours longer to get to my destination.,Aer Lingus,,3,

After Ryanair changed their flight times to Dublin which did not help me I changed to Aer Lingus.

The prices are always a little higher than the other company's but I would not change back.,Aer Lingus,,,

Returning from New Zealand I flew Air NZ Premium Economy to SFO (normally I go All Air NZ AKL to SFO/LAX to LHR-Belfast). However this trip I availed of Aer Lingus' new service from SFO to DUB to cut out a flight. Seats were incredibly cramped and uncomfortable with very small seat pitch and minimal recline which the passenger beside me commented on also as they boarded. Food was utterly disgusting my alleged beef Stroganoff actually tasted worse than it looked which was no mean feat I didn't even attempt a 2nd mouthful. Wine was extra $5USD. For a long haul flight costing over $900USD one way I think this is a bit mean ""breakfast"" was a joke a cling film wrapped ham and cheese roll and about 100ml of water in a foil sealed plastic tub tossed out. The whole experience just felt like a cost-cutting exercise. IFE was average/poor small selection of mostly dated material.

Passengers on flight 661 from Vienna to Dublin were left stranded at the gate for close to two hours past the posted departure time. Monitors in the area claimed the flight to be on time. There we absolutely no Aer Lingus or any other airport employees in the gate area during this time. The security personnel-the only non passengers we could access - refused to assist the passengers as we all became increasingly frustrated at the lack of information. We made phone calls to the Vienna airport (they must share the blame for this debacle as well) and Aer Lingus. No one offered any help whatsoever. Aer Lingus has apparently trained their employees to respond to any question or concern with a very irritating reply: ""We understand that you are frustrated"". This is all we heard from Aer Lingus employees throughout this flight. Not one Aer Lingus employee responded with appropriate action. At check in we were promised help with a seating request that I had tried to manage multiple times before arrival. No help was ever provided. The hot meal was frustrating as well. Many passengers were left with no option for the meal. This is no way to respect paying customers. We will avoid Aer Lingus in the future as it is apparent that they are in no way interested in appropriate customer service.",Aer Lingus,,2,

I saw one lady bring on a case large shopper and two large plastic bags! I had checked in a bag and placed a duty free bag in the overhead bin asked to remove it and place it at my feet so a passenger could place a large case in there - flatly refused. This is not the first time this has happened and ruins an otherwise usually pleasant journey compared with the other main airline operating out of Dublin.

Outward journey via Boston (second leg with Jetblue which was great) as the direct flight was sold out for days around my date of travel. Thankfully got one of the last seats on the direct flight on the return journey. Business class wasn't in the budget for this trip but the seats in economy were fine (I'm 6'0'' tall). I ordered one of the special meals for the Boston flight which was well worth it had the regular meal from SFO to DUB which was fine and you could help yourself to drinks and snacks from the galley at any time. The service is consistent the aircraft's always immaculate the personal entertainment has plenty of choice and the staff generally very friendly and helpful. You can select most seats on the aircraft for free at time of booking. Lets hope AL go daily on this route in 2015.,Aer Lingus,,5,

The flight crew and planes have always been first rate and the food while never great was at least passable. On our flight (EI-111) from Shannon to JFK we were served a meal that was quite possibly the worst we have ever been served on any airplane. We opted for the chicken ""dinner"" that came with some sort of rice as well as something called ""Spicy Salad"" if I recall correctly. The salad was inedible. If this is the type of food we can expect from Aer Lingus in the future I can assure you that we will be looking for a different carrier on our next trip.",Aer Lingus,,4,

No problems with being on time staff was friendly and efficient. I was especially impressed when we got into Dublin a bit late and were personally escorted through the lines in order to make our connection on to Paris.

What is going on with the re-instated check-in / bag drop queues at Brussels? I say re-instated because after online check-in finally came to BRU airport there have never been any issues with this flight in either checking in or dropping bag lines in Brussels. However last two times in June and this morning there were huge queues on both the Aer Lingus check-in line and bag drop/Gold circle line. And they both seem to advance eternally slow. Why does it seem to take so long per passenger to simply drop off a bag? I ended up getting fed up and bypassing altogether and brought my bag through security and got it checked at gate which is an added nuisance but one time I had skipped breakfast and really needed to get past security to eat something before collapsing. I am not sure what is causing the problem but there seems to be some ambiguity about the queuing lines for the check-in and bag drop / gold circle and people just seem to pass no heed of which is the correct line and join one or the other whichever is shorter. I think they need some better identification or barriers between the two to snake the queues to make it work better. Or a staff member guiding people correctly.,Aer Lingus,,,

1540,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,4,3,,4,6,Aer Lingus customer review,R Warren (United Kingdom) 6th July 2014,unk,Flew BRS-DUB-YYZ then YQG-YYZ-DUB-BRS in June 2014 as it was convenient to fly from our home airport rather than drive to London for a direct flight. Could not check in online as we had not booked directly with airline which meant an early start at the airport and no seats together. BRS-DUB with Stobart and a tiny noisy twin-prop as you might expect for such a short flight. DUB-YYZ plane looked brand new - think this route had only just started flying - and was full. 3-3 configuration felt very cramped. Drinks and food OK but not served until about 2 hours into the flight and no pre-landing snacks left by the time they got to us on the back row - we were offered a selection of biscuits instead. Service was fine apart from this. IFE selection limited and touchscreen system somewhat temperamental. Not a full-service airline so alcoholic drinks had to be paid for (we were prepared and brought euros just for this). On return YQG-YYZ sector by Air Canada - checked bags through to BRS for us. YYZ-DUB was a night flight but drinks and food again served after 2 hours water on board not working so no tea or coffee (or water in the toilets) lights not dimmed at all though a blanket and pillow were provided. Flight seemed to be on time leaving but arrived 30 mins late though no there was no mention of this or apology from the crew. It was only on the very long walk from the gate that we realised there'd been a delay and had to run then be fast- tracked through security just getting to the gate for our connecting flight as it closed behind us. Needless to say our bags didn't follow us for a couple of days. You get what you pay for and Aer Lingus were a little cheaper and a lot more convenient than other airlines for us. For a 7hr flight they were fine and I might be tempted by the convenience of the DUB US immigration pre-clearance to fly to NYC or Boston with them but I wouldn't travel any further.,Aer Lingus,,3,

We booked Aer Lingus because it was the most cost-effective option to New York from Birmingham with a short connection time. I was apprehensive above flying Aer Lingus based on previous reviews. The BHX-DUB sector was on an Aer Arran (now Stobart Air) ATR which was practically empty with overhead bins that accommodated carry- on's but the aircraft was very noisy. DUB-JFK was an A330 in 2-4-2 configuration. Seats and leg room were ok. Seat back TV entertainment was limited and not the most user friendly. Alcoholic beverages have to be paid for and there was only one round of soft drinks. The meal was mediocre and the pre-arrival snack was a flapjack. The crew constantly seemed in a hurry to distribute meals and drinks to the point where they practically chucked it at you before moving on. The crew then disappeared not to be seen until arrival. Whenever I fly transatlantic in economy I always seem to be disappointed. Nothing beats the middle eastern carriers on service. The only benefit of flying Aer Lingus is leaving from a local airport and the US pre-immigration clearance in Dublin which enables one to arrive in the US like a domestic passenger and avoid the lengthy immigration queues. Price however is comparable to other carriers.,Aer Lingus,,2,

While she assured us that we would make the flight it was a harrowing experience after we arrived at the airport 1 hour and 20 minutes early. At the gate one employee handled boarding and she had to check a number of bags because the overhead bins were inadequate for a typical carry on. We paid extra for upgraded meals which were terrible and I hate to think what those that did not upgrade had to eat. The attendants from Dublin to Orlando were no shows except for the meal service and a laughable cookie snack. I would never recommend Aer Lingus to anyone.,Aer Lingus,,3,

The Dublin to Orlando journey was very uncomfortable the seats are far too narrow the leg room is a minus and the arm rests are far too narrow. All in all a horrible journey. The flight was very smooth. The air hostesses were abrupt while trying to accommodate everyone. I will think twice before I book another long flight with Aer Lingus.,Aer Lingus,,2,

The entertainment screen can be pretty difficult to see if the shade is left up. EI should maybe roll out a business 'lite' for this route and throw free something or other into the mix but really it's quite a short flight so not hugely important but might be a nice touch. Bought a breakfast quite nice and filling. Crew the usual brand of EI pleasant. Usual happened on landing and has happened the last few times it's almost like someone has a peek out of a window and wonders what a plane is doing there as if it's a surprise. Waited an age to get on stand even though multiple were empty equally as long for a land bridge and then another 20 mins for luggage. Fine in the air but the ground needs work.

I am in full support of the labor action by the crew but I will never recommend Aer Lingus to anyone. We were not seated together so we could not help each other with our bags and the crew could easily have rectified this at boarding. A six hour flight sitting eight rows apart! This was not necessary. We paid over $500 in extra expenses because of the strike and the best the cabin crew offered was an extra cup of tea which was very nice but not quite enough. Avoid Aer Lingus.,Aer Lingus,,3,

Excellent plane. The cabin crew were very helpful and friendly. The meal on the plane going over was excellent it was off their new sky menu. I got the steak it was lovely. It was first class dining in economy class. It was well worth the €17.50 because that included a glass of wine. I would recommend getting this.

Excellent service overall. Flights departed on time arrived early. The return was on one of the new aircraft. The Aer Lingus lounge in T2 is excellent and well worth the short detour. Only point to note is that all the Regional flights take off from the one gate in Dublin T2. You proceed downstairs onto the same level as US pre clearance through gate 412. I almost missed the bus over to the morning flight only for the fact that a ground staff called out 'anyone else for Bristol'. The screen at the gate advised next flight was the BRS flight and the Glasgow was boarding first. So perhaps they need to look at that or advise that there is a short bus ride over to the aircraft. Otherwise well recommended Vs the competition and the fare was excellent value for a short flight.,Aer Lingus,,,

Boarding on the outward and return was calm and civilised and the ATR aircraft clean and comfy enough for a short hop. Check-in staff and the crew onboard were polite and there was an adequate range of snacks and drinks for purchase onboard. Terminal 2 at Dublin was smart and stylish. The only drawback was the long lines for check in and bag drop on the return flight but there were a large number of people travelling that day - many returning after the Giro.,Aer Lingus,,,

First time on Aer Lingus and the biggest draw was the excellent fare. Having said that I won't recommend except for bargain hunters. BCN-Dublin is basically a low cost flight curiously more comfortable than the 757 they used for the transatlantic leg. This must be the narrowest twin-engine plane around very narrow seats (and I'm on the slim side) and little legroom on top of that. I heard many people commenting on the lack of space. The personal entertainment system is not bad although only a few recent releases plus some shows and documentaries and music and maps. Food on the outbound flight was awful and made me ill afterwards so I avoided it on the inbound and brought my own food. Drinks service is seriously cheap no free alcohol and just water orange juice or Coke/Sprite available. Crew was friendly but never followed up on the one occasion (each flight) I went to the galley to ask for something even though they said they'd bring it to my seat. Transfer at Dublin was easy but with a lot of walking. I won't fly this particular route with them again.,Aer Lingus,,4,

However recently I flew with them to Munich and have to say I was very impressed overall with the service. I checked in on my mobile presented my boarding card on my mobile and had no problems using it getting through security. The aircraft was an A320 I was seated at row 12a which was an emergency exit so I had plenty of leg room on way out. Food was of good quality although I would have liked even a complimentary tea or coffee instead of 2.50 but only a small negative. On my return home the journey was a little more eventful which ended with me collapsing in the middle of the cabin. I can not commend the cabin crew enough for looking after me and administering the necessary first aid etc to ensure I was safe and comfortable. The crew were professional calm and reassuring which now looking back on it is what some other airlines are missing. I will definitely be a convert back to Aer Lingus.,Aer Lingus,,3,

Another hour passed while they tested the engine. We then had to ""deplane"" because they couldn't fix the engine. We were herded onto another plane and they took us yet again through the safety procedures. Then they proceeded to offer us tea and coffee for which they charged 2.5 euros. Because of the delay I missed my international flight by half an hour. Nevertheless the flight attendants insisted all those with connecting flights go to the terminals where their flights had already left. I spent 3.5 hrs trudging through Heathrow trying to get home. Finally after going through security 3 times in one day I arrived back at the Aer Lingus desk at terminal one. They gave me a voucher for a hotel that they told me (and wrote on the voucher form) was in Terminal 4. It was in Terminal 5. Another hour of trudging around Heathrow trying to find the hotel. The new flight I was booked on did not leave for 24 hours. Aer Lingus is the worst airline I have ever experienced. Never travel with Aer Lingus.",Aer Lingus,,1,

The difference of the inflight experience between KLM and Aer Lingus was incredible: the Aer Lingus flight was actually an endurance. Indifferent cabin crew and no service whatsoever without paying. The only good thing is that KLM assigned me an aisle seat on the first row allowing me to disembark quickly when the flight arrived at Cork Airport.,Aer Lingus,,,

Seats were ""downgraded"" to much worse ones in the back plane flight attendance slept for most of the flight and I had to wait 20 mins to get some water to take some headache pills.

I was disappointed with the movie selection offered by the in-flight entertainment. Compared to Delta there were far fewer movies to choose from and they were not current titles. Expect ones you've already seen 5 years ago. The hot meal was the usual chicken or beef options and was nothing to write home about. The pre-landing snack was a flapjack. They give you a knife and fork to eat it bizarrely. I guess this airline just loves wasting money. The armrests between seats do not go all the way up to prevent passengers lying down on a row of four. Annoying if you want to catch a quick nap. Overall I was disappointed with the flight given how much Aer Lingus charge for a one-way. I'll try another airline for the return journey.,Aer Lingus,,2,

Crew very attentive and flight on time both ways. Would definitely use them again instead of Ryanair from Stansted. Only gripe was hand luggage allowance.

If you are tall forget any leg room or comfort! Unfathomable why arm rests do not totally lift up to increase possible passenger comfort! The chicken curry was frankly awful. Crew were more interested in socializing with each other than providing passenger service. There were times that the crew area sounded more like an Irish pub - loud and noisy! And then there is the fact that for all connecting Aer Lingus flights you must be re-screened for airline security! It took us an hour to clear Chicago security in order to make our connecting flight so allow additional time for this glitch!

1567,,Business Class,,,yes,3,5,3,,3,5,Aer Lingus customer review,Zafrullah Hamzah (Ireland) 21st April 2014,unk,"Dublin-CDG return this was on a flex fare so not really in business class as such as business class is non existent on short haul flights. While the service from the cabin crew was friendly and efficient I note several issues that management needs to address. Flex fare entitles you to access to airport lounges. This needs to be made stress free for passengers. This time I received the invitation by email but as I had changed the dates as I am entitled to do I used the original lounge invitation (as no new invitation came by e-mail). No problems encountered in Dublin but while in Paris the staff in the Icare lounge came back to me while I was sitting down and eating to verify that the original lounge invitation reference matched my flight reference. I don't blame her as she was very apologetic for having had to do so. Surely if this is an issue for ground staff Aer Lingus should send a new invitation when you change the dates. In some previous flights the invitation did not come at all and Aer Lingus did not reply to my queries and there were issues getting access to the lounge without this ""invitation"". Perhaps Aer Lingus does not really bother with this as most people don't really bother with paying the higher flex fares. However for those who pay they should get what they pay for without any stress. I would also suggest that if you pay this fare you should at least be entitled to one meal and one drink on your flight since the fare costs 3 to 4 times more the cheaper fares. I will continue to use Aer Lingus as I live in Ireland and I find their cabin crew generally friendly and efficient but I hope management takes note of my comments and suggestions. If they don't address these issues they may find more and more people opt for their competitors like Ryanair.",Aer Lingus,,,

Booked flex fare as it includes lounge access bags etc on this particular flight. Aer Lingus use the the Airbus 330 so you can reserve the seats normally used in Premier Class (economy service). All good nice crew as per previous comments the IFE is a bit of a joke even in the premier seats the remote control doesn't sync with the screen and the touch screen has to be ""thumped"" to get any reaction. Choice of movies and TV was poor but I didn't take the flight to view movies used my iPad. Onboard wifi available at 11.95 euros per hour return flight same good crew but I felt a little stretched as they now operate with minimum crew numbers of 8 on board as against 11 when I last flew this route. One comment I do have to make ..there has been huge media coverage on Aer Lingus launching their new ""Bia"" inflight menu by celebrity chef Clodagh McKenna someone should point out not everyone in Ireland is as addicted to cheese Ms McKenna appears to be! Every single sandwich and snack has one type of cheese or another added even on the pre-order meals it's a choice of cheese or more cheese. I'm a great believer in not trying to fix something that wasn't broken. Your old pre-order menu and onboard menu was edible! Take a tip from other airlines purchase on board menus.

This was unsuitable so I called the customer services and without any hassle we were moved to a flight departing Dublin for the original date. When we checked in via the self check in machine our pre booked seats had changed and when mentioned to the desk staff they quickly corrected our seats back to the original with a sincere apology. The morning flight was on an A330 the advantage to this was we had IFE for the short 3 hour flight but it was a welcomed bonus. Crew were friendly and accommodating to any request and seemed to enjoyed serving the customers with a smile even when it was a full flight. This was a faultless flight in every respect arriving at destination bang on time. I really can't fault this airline every single employee I had connect with either from the call center to the gate agents to the cabin crew made us feel welcomed. It is a shame that the return flight from Malaga to Belfast left to early for us otherwise I would have made this a return trip.,Aer Lingus,,5,

They made us run to a flight that was taking off in 20 minutes and gave us a voucher to a holiday inn if we don't make it. Of course we didn't make it! We had to go through security all over again! Their phone lines go down at 9.45 ET which means when we call after missing the 8:05 flight to LA they're closed they put us on an infinite loop hold! Flight and airport wait time total was 14 hours! Now we're just stuck in Chicago and wouldn't have been if anyone would have put in any real effort in to get us home like putting us on the 9.25 flight that would have given us plenty of time to get to the terminal from international.

Loads of free pretzels for some reason which were horrid. No choice of snack and a very small orange juice break. Coming back we had paid for an upgrade for our seats we were shocked to find ourselves in the middle row of the plane no where near our allocated seats. Complained to air hostess who said they had changed the plane so therefore had been downgraded. No compensation and certainly no refund. Eventually after 2 months complaining we got our upgrade money back no compensation for the stressful flight home though. Also on the way back the movies were constantly interrupted with news of Aer Lingus charity work and asking for money. I had no issues donating the rest of our dollars but would have done so without being asked 10 times.,Aer Lingus,,2,

I weigh around 108 lbs and was traveling with my 145 lb brother the seat felt like concrete. Like one of the other reviews I have to sit on the pillow. These retro- fitted planes are the pits. The seat in front of me was 12 inches from my nose (the screen was basically in my face.) The arm rests don't fold all the way back so you have to be a circus contortionist to get out of your seat. Two people cannot pass one another even if they're going sideways. An older gentleman literally fell into what was luckily an empty seat trying to get back to his seat. The flight attendants were pleasant enough except for one male who thought he was ""large and in charge"". The food was the usual stuff basically it was edible. My brother needs a cane for walking and were with the other handicapped to get on the plane on the return flight. Unfortunately we ended waiting 20 minutes in the cold ramp thing (can't think of the right term) that leads to the plane while cargo was being loaded. That's right cargo not luggage. Yep the people who need canes and walkers were standing around for 20 minutes. As for the entertainment it didn't really matter since I can't look at a screen that's right in my face.",Aer Lingus,,,

Both flights had less than 2 hours layover in Chicago. Since you have to change terminals and go through security again this layover is just unacceptable. The LAX group barely made the flight. It was almost fully boarded when we got to the gate and we did not dilly dally at all. The flight from Denver was 20 minutes late. Our friend and 5 other people ran from Terminal 1 to Terminal 5 and arrived at the gate at 5 minutes before takeoff time. All 6 passengers were denied boarding. They watched the plane pull away from the gate. The exasperating thing is that the Aer Lingus staff at the gate take no responsibility and show no empathy for this issue. It should be noted that we arrived in Dublin 1.5 hours early. So waiting 5 minutes to board those 6 passengers would not have impacted the arrival at all. Then to make it worse on our return flight they canceled my friends upgraded meal. Their logic was ""well you weren't on the flight to Dublin for your upgraded meal so we canceled your return meal"". I agree with the post about the seat arm rest not going up. Not because you can't spread out but because you cannot get out of your seat to go to the bathroom. Bottom line never again and I would not recommend Aer Lingus to anyone.",Aer Lingus,,4,

Pretty quiet flight not too busy and plenty of space to stretch out although the middle armrest not lifting up all the way is pretty annoying if you're trying to spread out a bit. Fantastic crew. Return flight was fine food not as good and again great crew. However why is this flight scheduled to leave at the time it does (5.30 pm) and then arrive into Dublin 5.5 hours later it's fast but when you land in Ireland it's still only 11 pm in NYC. If the flight is that short and apparently it regularly is then could it not be scheduled it to arrive in Ireland the same day as it leaves NYC. Also I think it was a surprise to ground crew that we got back so early as we had to wait 50 mins for bags to arrive. Aside from that though good round trip.,Aer Lingus,,4,

The seats were smaller than Ryanair and for some unknown reason tilted so it was like we were going to be launched into the sky. The whole flight was extremely uncomfortable and hot. Out of interest can Aer Lingus passengers not count as they seem to have trouble working out where their seats are?

Very pleased with the service overall. The outbound flight on Tuesday was lightly booked and we got away early. Terminal 2 is very pleasant to use and even the security area was moving quickly. This was the first time I had used the pre-order meal service and it worked well in getting the breakfast before the main cabin service began. It is good value and I would estimate that about 10 of the 50 or so passengers had pre-ordered. Coming back was even easier at Gatwick airport and this was an almost full flight. The cabin crew were especially good. I ordered tea and the cheese board (could do with a little more cheese). Weather was bad coming into Dublin in the aftermath of the storms and I could tell we weren't going to be able to land from the approach and just before touchdown we went on a go around. The Captain came on and was very re-assuring and explained what had happened and again the cabin crew were very reassuring in making the extra safety announcements.

Outbound - The flight attendants always had a smile and were very helpful throughout. The only negative thing about the outbound flight was that there was a mother that did nothing but shout at her kids from the moment we took off until the moment we landed and when your flight is at 8.30 in the morning it's the last thing you want. Inbound flight DUB-CWL flight EI3298 31/10/13 - we left Dublin later than scheduled due to the fact there was a technical fault with a light in the cockpit and could not take off until it was solved. Within minutes engineers were onboard and both the captain and flight attendants kept us up to date with what was going on and reassuring us that everything was going well. The flight attendants on the inbound flight were much friendlier and talkative which is a great thing to have on an airline. Even though our flight departed late we landed just 5 minutes later than scheduled.

Inbound my neighbour had 3 shopping bags and a coat on the middle seat and not an eyelid batted? Food service is also always hit a miss outbound I was able to buy a breakfast offering on return nothing was available. Also I note the seat belt sign seems to stay on unusually longer than any other airline probably to keep passengers seated longer in order for service prep. Seats are comfortable for short haul leather but starting to wear slightly. Gold Circle club is a waste of time. At Dublin I attempted to check in at a computer terminal with my passport and told to report to a physical desk for check in. Oh joy huge queues luckily I tried another machine and it worked fine.

The transatlantic flights are always pleasant clean aircraft with friendly staff. IFE is adequate with personal seat-back TVs. Only complaints are that the economy seats are pretty hard and uncomfortable - they're actually nicer on the short-haul flights. I usually have to sit on the pillow to be comfortable. Also the departure gate area at ORD is too small for the number of passengers on the flight - numerous passengers end up standing and sitting on the floor in the hallway. Never had any serious issues with flight delays or baggage issues.

Aer Lingus was the only airline flying this route on that day so I had booked them as opposed to BA. We had some extra baggage so I went ahead and booked an extra bag ahead of time for 15 Euro. When I got to the airport I was told that although I had booked and paid for an additional bag I was still only allowed the same baggage weight allowance for one person (20kg). I cannot understand why anyone would want to purchase an extra bag without wanting extra weight. I assumed I would be allowed 40kg when I booked the extra bag but I was still only allowed 20kg which would have been the same weight as if I had not booked the extra bag. I am sure that a lot of other passengers fall for this! In all fairness Aer Lingus is a good airline to fly light. They have very competitive prices if you travel light but it can cost you your shirt and pants literally if you are over weight. I almost had to pay 300 Euro in over weight fess. Fortunately the staff at check in allowed me to manipulate the items in my luggage. I carried three coats in my hang on the plane and adjusted items between my luggage and hand luggage.,Aer Lingus,,1,
1594,,Economy Class,,,no,3,4,3,,3,3,Aer Lingus customer review,N Harvey (United Kingdom) 22nd November 2013,unk,London Gatwick to Dublin on 15/11/2013 AE 249 - 9pm flight. Friday flight - delayed yet again due to Aer Lingus passengers taking their time to get on and off the plane. People again had too much hand luggage and the ground staff were forced to place some in the hold. Late take off due to passengers being selfish and hogging the overhead bins and generally being thoroughly stupid with regards to the basics such as sitting down quickly and being able to count from 1 to 29. The crew found it frustrating and its credit to them they kept calm during a very unnecessary delay. I'm finding this behaviour very annoying and am going back to Ryanair who at least make the effort to be on time and their passengers don't push and shove like Aer Lingus passengers.,Aer Lingus,,,
1595,,Economy Class,,,no,4,3,3,,1,unk,Aer Lingus customer review,Davis Daniel (United States) 21st November 2013,unk,The service and food was adequate considering we got a good deal on round trip flights between SLC and Dublin. Rather it would have been a good deal if Aer Lingus didn't end up charging my $521 for two more tickets to return home. After getting a little lost in Dublin we arrived at the airport with a little over an hour before our departure time. When we tried to check in at the kiosk it said check-in was closed. The attendant directed us to the check-in desk. They told us check-in had closed 15 minutes ago. When I pointed out that there were no lines at security and that an hour would still be plenty of time to get to our flight they still refused to let me check in and sent me to another desk to find another flight. The frustrating thing was I presumably would have been allowed to check in on the kiosk if I had been there 15 minutes earlier but I still could have had to wait in line to check my bags. That was not the case. I was able to walk right up to the desk because the airport was not very busy. When I went to the customer service desk we still had 55 minutes before our departure. Told they could get us to the U.S. that night but we'd have to find our own connections but she was not willing to quote the price of those other options. As it turns out it looks like Aer Lingus sold our seats out from under us. Yes I suppose I should have arrived earlier but I've made long haul flights before with less time to spare. Not a good ending to our honeymoon.,Aer Lingus,,3,
1596,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,P McMahon (United Kingdom) 5th November 2013,unk,I was rebooked with Aer lingus to Dublin after our BA flight was cancelled due to technical difficulties. We were very impressed with the friendly and professional service offered. The aircraft was spotless fresh and bright. The crew kept us informed of our progress and had issued a very warm welcome on boarding. On the downside we had booked on a full service airline where drinks and a snack were included on Aer Lingus you pay. However the full breakfast I ordered was delicious and well worth the money. I look forward to booking with you in the future.,Aer Lingus,,3,
1597,,Business Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,N Lezotte (United States) 4th November 2013,unk,Best experience I have had flying transatlantic. Flew round trip MCO-DUB 10/22 and returned 10/31. Continuing service to CDG. Very friendly and ever present staff on the transatlantic portion. The seat turned into an almost lay flat bed which provided a sound sleep in both directions. Wines were well chosen and poured frequently. Meals were well presented with a variety of appetizers before and hot breads during dinner. The staff service and the overall cleanliness of the plane convinced me that I had made the right choice for an airline. The connection DUB-CDG was a packed economy flight. For an hour and a half flight it was tolerable. Aer Lingus competes with Ryanair on this route so everything including water is for sale. My choice from now on for transatlantic flights. Clearing customs and immigration in Dublin is a real plus. American customs and immigration are rude and hostile but about what you would expect from them.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1598,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,5,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,J Fox (Ireland) 4th November 2013,unk,JFK-DUB EI108 Nov 1st. Another more or less faultless flight with Aer Lingus across the pond. Young cabin crew who were enthusiastic smiling and charismatic. Very attentive to all passengers on a late night flight from New York to Dublin. Pilots again very informative on routing weather and arrival time which is great. Crew apologetic for delay leaving JFK but flight still arrived 55 mins ahead of schedule. Added bonus was the fact that the crew played some great modern music while taxiing to stand after arrival. One minor criticism was the pace of check- in/bag-drop. Great job all round.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1599,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,5,5,,5,8,Aer Lingus customer review,Nick Serpell (United Kingdom) 4th November 2013,unk,DUB-ORD and return. Both flights on Airbus 330-300. Seating seemed tight in both width and legroom compared with other airlines we have used. We booked their so called Choice seats for which we paid extra but there is no real advantage to this other than you get to board with business class. Aer Lingus offers the facility to pre-order better quality meals and I would definitely recommend doing this. Much better than the normal economy offer and you get free wine. The service on the flight out was exemplary. They had lost my wife's pre-booked meal but rustled her up a business class meal and gave us extra wine to compensate. Film choice is not nearly as good as we have experienced on Far East airlines and very annoyingly they truncated the film service towards the end of the flight to show a video for their pet charity which they had already screened at the start of the flight. Big bonus being able to clear US customs in Dublin so arrive at Chicago as domestic passengers. On the flight back they woke us up three hours after serving dinner for a cheese roll at 3.30am Suggest they abandon this idea and let people sleep a bit longer. Overall it was as good as economy gets on European airlines although not anything like as good as the likes of Singapore and Malaysia. Would fly with them again.,Aer Lingus,,3,

Remote stand in DUS but efficient transfer via bus so no complaints. So return last night full flight (215 people). Departure at 9.20pm. At about 8.30 at gate announcement made asking everyone to go downstairs collect bags and exit for bus transfer to Cologne where our aircraft was! Turns out curfew at Dussledorf means no jet aircraft after 10pm. Inbound flight was delayed which would have prevented a departure prior to 10 resulting in an overnight. All handled pretty well to the point that obviously this was not the first time this happened! Bit of a pain back through security etc in Cologne and people who had bought duty free in Dussledorf had some issues. Ended up arriving in Dublin at 1am about 3 hrs late. Flight itself fine. My only comment is on one attendant. Few German lads in row opposite me having a few drinks. A bit spirited but nothing to bother anyone. In fact the young attendant on board had a few laughs with them chatting about best pubs to go to in Dublin. Then as other attendant passing they were a bit loud and I noticed her giving them a hard stare. I travel a lot and know when people are behaving in a poor manner but not in this case. She had a furious look the whole trip. Ok so like the rest of us on a Friday night not impressed running so late but we were all in the same boat and I thought the passengers were remarkably stoic and took it all on the chin.,Aer Lingus,,,

Aircraft spotlessly clean new and unworn. Entered fleet in 2010 only. PTV screens were great with excellent documentaries although choice of good movies limited. Staff professional and efficient.

Embarking Dublin to Rome we were treated like small children (we are senior citizens) and were not permitted to take our carry on onto the plane.

1610,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,2,,4,5,Aer Lingus customer review,M Wickham (Ireland) 25th September 2013,unk,Flew Cork-Nice return recently. Outward flight was fine and on time. Food on flight was quite poor and bad value. Aer Lingus seemed to have changed caterers. Return flight was a shambles. All passengers were boarded on time and the pilot announced that all was ready with just some paperwork to complete which would take just a few minutes. Time passed slowly and the minutes mounted up. After about 15 minutes the pilot said that there was a slight problem and he was waiting for an engineer to sort things out. The engineers duly arrived and were to be seen examining so instruments in the cockpit. They left and returned a number of times and the cabin crew did their best to reassure the passengers and were unable to begin catering of any sort because of customs regulations. After about and hour a supervisor went to the cockpit and some more examining of instruments continued. The pilot said at this stage that there was a fuel gauge problem and after about another 15 mins he announced that the problem had been satisfactorily solved. So one and a half hours late we departed.,Aer Lingus,,,

When the doors closed I asked a flight attendant if I could take a seat in one of the empty emergency seats. There were 3 consecutive seats empty. You would think that I had just stolen the crown jewels! The young flight attendant berated me with sarcasm ""you have to pay for them"" in her loudest Dublin accent. This is not the first time I've experienced this type of condescending attitude from an Aer Lingus flight attendant. Totally unnecessary.

Got a great deal on the ticket price very comfortable A330 planes on the long haul segments with seat-back IFE with a great selection of movies and music very helpful and friendly crew and decent food/drink selection. All sectors were on time and transfers at SNN and DUB were fast and easy. In addition to the excellent all round service there are two major advantages to using Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel: Pre-clearance is available for all USA bound flights out of SNN and I believe selected flights out of DUB hence you arrive as a domestic passenger in the USA and walk straight out of the airport - the pre-clearance facilities in Shannon at least have virtually no queues and you can get through them in a matter of minutes so I suspect that even accounting for the layover time it is as quick as flying directly. Secondly Aer Lingus use T5 at JFK which is a marvellous Terminal loads of space seats eating and drinking options and really fast efficient (and surprisingly friendly) security - I believe that T5 is exception at JFK in this regard. All in all I would very highly recommend Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel to anyone.,Aer Lingus,,5,

Loved the lounges at both ends uncrowded and stylish. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Great in flight magazine. The new Terminal 2 at DUB is a delight. But the aircraft's are very cramped the flight out was completely full and I felt very trapped even being on the front row. The lack of proper inflight catering brings the on board service down combined with the cramped seat pitch and no free on board catering creates a no fills feel. Even if you pay and pre order a meal on a flexi ticket you lose it if you change your time. Surely modern IT could cope with re-assigning it.,Aer Lingus,,3,

Seats were a bit hard but ok for a 3 hour flight. Staff again friendly and helpful and flight on time. Baggage on carousel on arrival. Aer Lingus is definitely my preferred carrier out of Ireland.,Aer Lingus,,,
1616,,Economy Class,,,no,3,3,2,,1,1,Aer Lingus customer review,Tan Jerry (Singapore) 10th September 2013,unk,I flew on a flight from Cork to Paris yesterday and to my horror I was scolded by ground staff that my baggage was overweight. I was shocked because I bought a more expensive ticket that allowed me to carry 2 bags. However in the fine print of Aer Lingus it states that whether you carry one or two bags the maximum weight allowable is 20kg. This makes absolutely no sense in having 2 bags of 10kg since the bag itself weights about 2kg to 3 kg so you lose out if you carry 2 bags. Your total weight allowance shrinks from 20kg to 17kg if you carry one bag and if you carry two bags it shrinks from 20kg to 14kg as the 2 bags will weigh 6kg in total. So I paid extra money for absolutely nothing. I thought that when you paid extra money you will be allowed to carry 2 bags of 20kg each (totalling to 40kg). This is the worse thing I found about Aer Lingus. I had to pay EUR75 for 5 kg overweight. Also this flight had no business class and I had taken the highest class available called Economy Class Flexi Fare. Even my Star Alliance Gold Card was not useful.,Aer Lingus,,1,

On boarding the aircraft at Boston Logan Airport for our flight we were greeted by a very welcoming flight crew. The aircraft was well maintained and very clean. As soon as we departed Boston beverage service was served. Complimentary soft drinks served but alcohol was not free which is ok. Dinner service began about 1 hour after departing and we were served chicken or beef. The meal service was delicious. Flight crew came around during dinner service with more beverages and water. More food available if we desired. Entertainment was excellent plenty of choices for movies. I have to say Aer Lingus is a wonderful airline with great service.,Aer Lingus,,5,

I feel that re-education in customer service would benefit many employees of Aer Lingus. Quite frankly food was almost thrown at us when served no smiles and no manners! My friend is a gold circle member and did not accept the dinner served he asked for cheese and crackers and was told there was none.,Aer Lingus,,4,

My most recent was from Milan Linate to Dublin. Flight was on time and all went smooth with luggage etc. All members of staff were helpful and accommodating. Food was good for aeroplane standard and was reasonably priced for being on a plane. Seats and leg space are excellent for economy class. I am once again flying with Aer Lingus in 2 weeks time to Lisbon from the excellent Dublin airport terminal 2. It is a brand new terminal. A great value airline.,Aer Lingus,,,

Flight transfer is very easy to navigate in Dublin and on this flight you actually pre-clear US customs in Dublin which is an added bonus. Business Class cabin extremely spacious on the A330 and you are warmly greeted with a nice amenity kit bottled water and champagne. Business Class dining is superb and well worth the upgrade cost in itself with a good choice of entrees. Service includes hot canapés salad and main cheese and biscuits together with a choice of desserts. You won't go hungry! Cabin crew are attentive and if you require extra refreshments you only have to ask. On return to Dublin you also get continental breakfast. Seats are comfortable and fully adjustable to how you want. There are extra buttons in the arm rest which allows you to individually control different parts of the seat including massage. IFE good although they seemed to have dimmed the brightness of the screen recently so you may need to close the window blind to watch. Overall great experience and have already booked Business Class for my next trip to Boston in October.,Aer Lingus,,4,

Flights were on time and boarding was well-organized. The seats were comfortable but everything looked tired and not exactly pristine. IFE is nearly impossible to use as the touch-screens wouldn't respond to pressure. The meal was okay (biryani chicken) though the piece of meat was about as big as an eraser. The flight attendants (save for one very nice girl) were sulky and bored and made us all feel like we were cattle. As we left the plane the cabin attendant didn't even look up into our faces when she said goodbye. In a nutshell the price was good but the service was shocking given the generally warm nature of all the Irish folk I know. Most peculiar.,Aer Lingus,,1,

As a fearful flyer trying to overcome it this was a pair of practice flights for me. Flight attendants could not have been more helpful and supportive especially as they are really busy on short flight. A320s were great and though it was a gusty crosswind day for landings never felt anything but safe and supported. One attendant even provided me with some extra reading material in case I needed it to help distract me and even bought me a drink from the trolley! Was not expecting such above and beyond service.

Incredibly disorganized ""mob boarding"" in Boston. Flight crew on outbound leg were quite grumpy and unfriendly. I had pre-ordered a vegetarian special meal with an allergy requirement. They got the allergy but not the veg part and I was presented with a hunk of chicken which the flight attendant said she thought was ""Just a bit of tofu."" Offered cheese and crackers. Returning I had called to make sure I got a suitable dinner. Well they had one but I heard them give it to the woman behind me. I had to explain to her that she had my food and get it back. On the return flight a flight attendant came with a big bag of blankets tossed the bag into the corner ripped the bag open and said not one word to anyone. No hot drinks available in the first round of service. Dinner trays stayed around far too long. On the return leg the promised ""afternoon tea service"" was delayed and was basically thrown at us.

Aer Lingus were punctual as I have always found on this route and the staff were pleasant enough. A major complaint is the terrible leg room their Airbus 319's which they received from Iberia. These aircraft are only just bearable for a shorter journey. I also found there to be too many in flight announcements selling food and goods.

I didn't order the upgraded meal because I didn't think it would be any better but from comments that I've heard next time I probably will next time. Flight attendants were friendly.,Aer Lingus,,5,

Nothing bad at all outbound on time departure and arrival flight crew were excellent ordered the ""Extra "" menu for Euro and it was worth every penny. Flight back you cannot order the extra menu which is a great shame again the flight crew were open friendly and very professional - flight left late and arrived very early. Couldn't fault them at all - spot on. Well done to Aer Lingus.",Aer Lingus,,2,
1638,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,5,5,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,L Sherwood (United States) 12th May 2013,unk,April 27 2013 we took an A330 Airbus from Dublin to Orlando direct. The food was the best I have had on an airline. All flight attendants were cheerful and courteous. The only complaint is that at Dublin airport our boarding passes stated that the gate closed at 10.55 am even though our flight did not leave until 12.40 pm. I do not appreciate being given misleading information like that even if the airline is only doing it to get the slackers to show up on time. I say leave them a couple of times when they are late and they will learn to be on time and not cause the rest of us to show up at the gate only to sit for almost two more hours after already spending two hours going through security and customs! Also the seat cushions on the plane are getting too compressed to have a comfortable trip lasting 9 hours. The seat cushions should be replaced with new ones.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1639,,Economy Class,,,no,3,4,3,,4,7,Aer Lingus customer review,Carmel McTague (Ireland) 8th May 2013,unk,"No real complaints about the flight or in service facilities. Main complaint is about the badly designed website. I was flying Shannon to Boston and then on to Tampa with JetBlue. AL kept emailing me to complete the ""Additional Information Required"". However their website kept rejecting my booking reference. Tried to email them (no reply). Tried over 3 days to telephone AL kept getting recorded messages. Spent at least 1 hour trying to get through to a ""person"". Eventually did to be told my booking reference was rejected as I was flying on to another destination (Tampa). Then she took the additional info and did it for me. Seems this is a routine problem! AL also could not print off Jetblue boarding card Jetblue referred me back to AL.",Aer Lingus,,3,
1640,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,3,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,Mike Palmer (United Kingdom) 6th May 2013,unk,LHR to Cork return. On time departure from Heathrow and early arrival into Cork. Early Departure from Cork and on stand 20 mins early into Heathrow. Clean cabin each way and efficient (if a bit brusque) cabin crew. Had reasonably priced drinks on the way out only with the bar service prompt and fast. We paid extra for row 1 which was worth every penny. The only downside was oversize bags in the cabin along with perhaps half of the plane breaking the one piece of hand baggage rule leading to no space in the overhead bins. On a par price wise with other competitors on the route (once extras are added in) but overall my preferred choice between London and Cork with good legroom pleasant staff and a reserved seat.,Aer Lingus,,,
1641,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,4,5,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,R Bruce (United States) 2nd May 2013,unk,JFK-SNN-JFK. Excellent flights in both directions. Cabin crew very professional and attentive. Found the check-in process at JFK terminal 5 with JetBlue staff to be extremely slow. Check-in at Shannon was excellent and very efficient. Clearing USA customs in Shannon saved a lot of time and aggravation that I have experienced coming in from other European countries.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1642,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,4,4,,5,8,Aer Lingus customer review,A Lynch (Ireland) 1st May 2013,unk,DUB-BRU-DUB good service and great value for money on this route. A321 almost 15 years old but clean and comfortable with excellent leather seats and adjustable head-rest. Ground service was competent and speedy and cabin crew were friendly professional and well groomed engaging with passengers. There is a newly updated menu with drinks and snacks available to purchase. I was disappointed to see that there is a now a more limited selection than previous versions of the menu but prices are still keen and quality is very good. All in all vastly superior to Ryanair when flying from Ireland to Belgium.,Aer Lingus,,3,
1643,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,P McCracken (Ireland) 28th April 2013,unk,Dublin - Santiago return. Both flights on time. Excellent service from Irish cabin crew. Food for purchase but reasonably priced and tasty. Only complaint was lack of staff at passport control in Dublin so long queues. Cant understand. Felt sorry for All non EU passport holders. Not Aer Lingus fault but only glitch in otherwise faultless travel experience.,Aer Lingus,,,

I have been positively surprised. Pretty new A330-202 good entertainment good food. The only weak point was the readiness of the staff in Dublin to solve a problem with ESTA Visa. Fortunately I was able to find a helpful person at Aer Lingus at the end.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1645,,Economy Class,,,no,3,2,2,,2,unk,Aer Lingus customer review,M Pimm (United Kingdom) 25th April 2013,unk,Booked to fly to Dublin from Birmingham on 18th April on the 14.50 flight. This flight was delayed 5 hours we had no information of any kind during this time. It was not until we got on board and the pilot explained what happened this is very bad practice. It would have been very helpful if we had an announcement just to explain why the plane was late and giving an estimated time of departure. As a result I missed my bus connection and my relatives had to come up to the airport to collect me at 8.30pm.,Aer Lingus,,,
1646,,Economy Class,,,no,2,4,2,,3,6,Aer Lingus customer review,R McCrea (United States) 24th April 2013,unk,We recently traveled from the US to Ireland. When we called in on seat assignments for the flight over we paid an extra $60 per person for seats that were to have more room (Rows 9-12) so we could sleep better. Turns out that the seats we had on the way home had more leg room and reclined further so that was wasted money. On the way home the entertainment recycled twice so there was a while where you couldn't watch a movie and since we were in the middle of one when it went down had to adjust it to get back to the spot where it crashed.,Aer Lingus,,4,
1647,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,P Cassin (Ireland) 21st April 2013,unk,DUB to NYC return. A330 found it comfortable and in flight services good. I would comment positively on the check in at Dublin handled quickly and with the US pre-clearance it saved massively on the US side landing in a domestic terminal. On return found the Aer Lingus ground staff in JFK friendly and efficient. Overnight flight to Dublin was quite and comfortable.,Aer Lingus,,4,
1648,,Economy Class,,,no,4,3,3,,4,5,Aer Lingus customer review,D Keenan-Bokr (Germany) 18th April 2013,unk,"Economy from Glasgow via Dublin to New York return. Glasgow to Dublin flight arrived on time and all US bound passengers were met at the arriving flight and bussed to the international terminal. For this flight we had US Pre-clearance at Dublin Airport. However waiting time was horrendous. Flight was due to depart at 10.15 and at 10.45 we still hadn't completed this procedure. Aer Lingus held the onward flight for all connecting passengers resulting in a one hour delay leaving Dublin. Airbus 330-300 seating was comfortable enough for the 6 hr flight. The on demand video system offered ample films. The headphones however of poor quality and sound. A pre-dinner drink was served. Soft drinks are free alcoholic drinks have to be paid for. Meal was mediocre and tasteless. The crew did not come around offering drinks. The younger cabin attendants were friendly. Older crew members acted like their job was a chore. Many not able to smile. Because we had pre-cleared US Immigration at Dublin we were therefore classified as a ""domestic flight"" and landed at Jet Blue's Terminal 5 in JFK. Because of this and the somewhat lower fare these points would be the only reason I would choose to fly Aer Lingus again.",Aer Lingus,,4,
1649,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,,,5,8,Aer Lingus customer review,Steve Smith (United Kingdom) 14th April 2013,unk,Flew on the Gatwick/Belfast route 4 times in 2 weeks. Saw today they've increased from 3 to 4 flights a day so I presume they're doing well. They are in direct competition now with FlyBe who used to have this route to themselves and competition can only be a good thing IMHO. AE flight times are very similar to BE although we left before them twice even though their departure time was first. I think that reflects the increased pressure Flybe have on their turnaround times. The service is better on AE even though you still have to pay for food and drink the planes are better (A319s) and were immaculate. Only had hand luggage so can't comment on airport check-in. I did mine using their phone app which worked perfectly. The only niggle is their charging to book seats in the first 5 rows I find it a bit money-grasping. Will definitely continue to use them on this route as long as the price and service continue in the same vein.,Aer Lingus,,,
1650,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,E Brown (Ireland) 11th April 2013,unk,Flew DUB-LGW-DUB recently and everything went smoothly. Paid extra for front seats Row 3 on way out and row 1 on way back for quick exit and was worth it. Also less hassle and pressure than Ryanair on same route and times. Tickets were only marginally dearer and not enough to make me join the rush for a seat on FR. Flight was on time in both directions even with de-icing procedures. Ground and flight staff were both excellent but sometimes I wish they would enforce the cabin baggage regulations - even a little bit.,Aer Lingus,,,
1651,,Business Class,,,yes,4,3,2,,3,6,Aer Lingus customer review,F Hogan (United Kingdom) 1st April 2013,unk,Travelled to JFK from LGW via DUB return. Went out coach and came back Business. The equivalent BA flight (coach both ways) would have been an extra £600 for the dates I wanted. The other thing was the convenience of using LGW instead of the awful LHR T5. Had a very early and quiet departure from LGW. Boarding was nearly on time and quite smooth. The food on board was appalling. It seems that if you pre- order meals you get far better quality. Maybe that should be made clear on the booking website. I needed to take some medication towards the end of the flight and asked the crew for a glass of water. It was provided in a very flimsy plastic 'glass'. Return leg in Business was on the evening redeye. Check-in was fine. Lounge was ok. Once the flight was called and I went to gate we still had another 30 mins wait. Business class seats had a huge control panel but no documentation on how to operate them. Trial and error eventually got the seat flat. The food was poor for business class. The white wine and fizz were excellent but the Italian red with the steak was disgusting. Breakfast was poor for business class. I would have expected an attempt at a cooked breakfast. But maybe that's why it was so much cheaper than BA.,Aer Lingus,,4,
1652,,Business Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,Patrick Jordan (Ireland) 21st March 2013,unk,DUB-MCO-DUB. Efficient check-in with added bonus of fast track security in Dublin. Good lounge experience particularly in Dublin. Recaro seats very comfortable. Food quality very good and quality wines served. Staff attentive without being intrusive. A very comfortable way to cross the Atlantic.,Aer Lingus,,,
1653,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,,,5,9,Aer Lingus customer review,B Kennedy (United Kingdom) 19th March 2013,unk,Flew on the new service from London Gatwick to Belfast City airport and was very impressed with the service. Great price lovely comfortable planes on time and very efficient boarding (probably helped that the plane was only 2/3rd full). Only drawback although not necessarily the airlines fault is the horrible small dingy and dirty departure gate they use at Gatwick South terminal.,Aer Lingus,,,
1654,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,T Coughlan (Ireland) 4th March 2013,unk,Cork to Malaga and satisfied with all aspects of the flight. On time comfortable pleasant crew good food and excellent value for money. I usually fly Ryanair from Shannon - who possess none of the above qualities - except blowing trumpets on arrival. For me to use Aer Lingus to travel to Spain means an extra 60 mile road trip which I am happy to take.,Aer Lingus,,,
1655,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,5,3,,3,7,Aer Lingus customer review,C Lawrence (United Kingdom) 28th February 2013,unk,I flew from Venice to Dublin on 24 Feb 2013. There was only one check-in agent for the entire flight. Venice Marco Polo airport is a nightmare to depart from as there are very few security desks and lots of flights. Queue for security was appalling and stretched out of the departure building! I stood in line for almost 2 hours and saw several flights between different groups of passengers from various countries. Small children and elderly people were very upset. As I stood in line my name was called for final boarding. I only just made it to the gate and saw that 3 other passengers were denied boarding. I was bussed out to the flight alone on a transfer bus. Flight was pretty full and departure delayed 45 mins - not the fault of Aer Lingus though. The seats were fine if cramped. Tea and a snack had to be paid for. The crew were very nice and worked hard. I am a QANTAS frequent flyer and opted for the Aer Lingus flight to gain some more points. I booked a Y class seat and yet have not been awarded any points at all by Qantas who blame Aer Lingus who in turn blame Qantas! The fare was not the cheapest as some rivals offered cheaper deals with a stop-over. I would use Aer Lingus again as I like their friendly staff. I feel that the check-in procedure at Venice needs to be examined and Aer Lingus ought to exert some pressure on the airport to improve the squalid experience in the airport.,Aer Lingus,,,
1656,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,M Wickham (Ireland) 14th February 2013,unk,Recently flew Cork - Lanzarote return. Both flights were on time and the service was excellent. Cabin crew very good particularly on return flight. Cabins were clean and tidy and Aer Lingus seems to have tightened up on the practice of allowing oversize baggage into the cabin. I had booked well in advance so price was quite reasonable. My usual gripe is with Cork Airport arrivals where the air bridges remain redundant and passengers have to brave the elements and 3 flights of stairs to get inside the airport building.,Aer Lingus,,,
1657,,Business Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,Alan Glazen (United States) 14th February 2013,unk,Business class #124 Chicago to Dublin very clean and new-feeling Airbus 330-300 fine staff very thoughtful and professional. The seat is very comfortable Recarro sport-type does not go fully flat but is very nice in all other conformations. Even though Aer Lingus doesn't match up with the fabulous seating/bedding of major liners they exceed the US carriers in other ways. We saved about $1500 versus those carriers and I felt it was a fine bargain. I'd fly them again for sure.,Aer Lingus,,4,
1658,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,Adrian Schaf (Germany) 14th February 2013,unk,I flew from Berlin Schönefeld (SXF) to Dublin (DUB). The flight lasted only 2 hours. The cabin was ok it was clean. The seat comfort was ok but not excellent. The staff service was excellent. The food was ok and the sky shop had a great selection. The inflight entertainment was ok but a bit boring.,Aer Lingus,,4,

After 1 hr 45 mins we were told what happened and that ""we at least know where the bags are"".

Flight took off on time but hit heavy winds on approach aborted landing and circled for approx 40 minutes before diverted to Shannon. Bussed to Cork. Return flight on 30th January very much the same. When approaching Birmingham told that aircraft was outside it landing limits with the weather. Aircraft circled for approx 1 hour over Birmingham tried to land and aborted then diverted to Luton. Again bussed back to Birmingham 4 hrs late. Why do they use this type of aircraft this time of year which is close or outside it operating limits. Surely pilots have accurate weather predictions.,Aer Lingus,,,

A very warm welcome from the Irish crew members upon boarding the aircraft. Soon after takeoff we were served beverage service and then our main dinner course of which was up to high standards. The main course consisted of chicken or beef. A very tasty meal. The crew members were all welcoming and served the passengers with full courtesy and friendliness. I have to say the crew always work hard on these flights and are a pleasure to have on board. I definitely will be flying with them in the near future.,Aer Lingus,,5,

I have travelled a lot with Aer Lingus and it seems they have moved away from the very low cost type of airline back to what they were. Was seated in row 2D adequate space (I'm 6ft 1). Crew very good as always and its nice to see the mature crew menders on board. I do have one gripe - Aer Lingus have a fantastic Deli/Pay Menu its a pity they never have any of the stock this is my 8th time since July with Aer Lingus where the stocks run out by the time the trolley hits row 2. I complained to the senior cabin crew member - she said agreed - that its always happening to them. Would still use them again no problem.,Aer Lingus,,,

I hadn't requested a vegetarian meal but the stewardess was nice enough to bring me extra salads and rolls. They came by often with drink service and to collect trash. The movies and shows available were great. I'm a very nervous flyer and as we were preparing to land a stewardess talked me through it and was very comforting.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1668,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,P Jacob (Germany) 8th January 2013,unk,Flying from a regional airport in Germany to Dublin at Christmas time over the past few years I have usually tended to use Lufthansa usually transiting via Frankfurt. However in 2012 I chose instead to connect via London Gatwick on the outbound and London Heathrow on the inbound UK parts of the journey. Boarding the flight for Dublin at London Gatwick I was struck by the friendly Irish humour when asked by the flight attendant whether the wrapped Christmas present in my open carry-on bag was for her! That set the tone for the flight and indeed the Christmas season! It just shows how much a friendly crew can add or detract from the flight experience. Aer Lingus offered a professional and friendly service throughout with surprisingly comfortable seats. Did not purchase any inflight catering or make any other purchases given the very short duration of the journey. T2 at Dublin was impressive and although there was a mishap with my luggage on arrival the matter was sorted efficiently and to my satisfaction. I will be using Aer Lingus again in a few months time and looking forward to it.,Aer Lingus,,,

Check in was fast boarding was smooth and the flight was pleasant to Dublin. Flew back January 6 2013 Dublin to JFK. Check in immigration and customs pre- clearance boarding were all smooth. The only issue and this is most likely not an Aer Lingus issue was the ridiculous walk from the plane to pick up baggage. Perhaps this was due to ongoing construction at the terminal. If not I feel for anyone that has trouble walking.,Aer Lingus,,4,

Two excellent flights both leaving and arriving early. Ok they have 'add-ons' at the time of booking but they are transparent about it and the luggage allowance is generous.

American Airlines flight from the US was late and missed connecting flight. Aer Lingus would not honor ticket and required new tickets to be bought. Ticket agent was rude.

Check in at JFK is quick and easy and the oasis lounge is comfortable well stocked and quiet. What sets Aer Lingus apart is the friendly crew and to warm genuine Irish welcome on boarding . Although it was a full overnight flight the crew provided excellent service with generous drinks top ups and above average J food. The almost flat bed is reasonably comfortable for the length of flight. I only managed an hours sleep as its a short hop over the pond. Nice continental breakfast towels and proper tea before landing. Bags off first and overall excellent value. Return leg on the 105 on New Years Eve was excellent. Friendly J check in with no wait new T2 lounge quiet and the benefits of pre-flight clearance in Dublin are immeasurable. Again great crew generous drinks good food and warm smiles.,Aer Lingus,,4,

Booking check-in all very straight forward only problem is had to queue along with other passengers at Southend Airport as no separate bag drop for online check in pax. Flight on time and first time in ATR42 aircraft. Very comfortable seating even with bags under seat in front of you. Allocated seating and not being treated like cattle is a big thumbs up from me. With this airline and Southend airport it has bought my faith back in commercial aviation. Would definitely use Air Lingus Regional again.,Aer Lingus,,,

Both flights were excellent with attentive staff good food and top- ups of drinks whenever you wanted. Staff did not disappear into galleys during either daytime or night time legs. IFE is very good with a good choice of up to date movies. There was a problem with this on the return and they only managed to get the outbound movies shown.

Aircraft Airbus A320 was 5 years old and was very clean and tidy. Fare was good 120 euro return cheaper by 30 than Ryanair however they are far superior to fly with and are very lenient with bag weight. Pity they do not fly more services into Shannon like SNN- MUN SNN-BCN and SNN-AMS. these would do very well for business and leisure people.,Aer Lingus,,3,

A330-200 was clean the seats were comfortable the inflight entertainment system was excellent the food acceptable and the cabin crew attentive. We paid the extra $100US round-trip per person for bulkhead/emergency row seating. It was well worth it. Row 11 A/C has excellent legroom. A draw back is that the entertainment monitor is between the seat and has to fold up as there is no seat in front of you. I would recommend Aer Lingus in the future.,Aer Lingus,,5,

The short flight Glasgow to Dublin is on a prop plane but is perfectly adequate for the short distance. Dublin-Orlando includes good entertainment food and most courteous cabin crew. A330 was very clean.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1683,,Economy Class,,,yes,2,4,,,3,6,Aer Lingus customer review,R Morgan (United Kingdom) 16th November 2012,unk,Cardiff to Dublin evening 11th November. ATR72 looked relatively new bright interior due to LED lights. Seating very cramped more than other ATR 72's I have flown bearable for one hour. The first and second rows have facing seats which were occupied by 2 drunk women. They managed to buy a round of drinks from the drinks trolley and continue their celebrations. The landing was smooth and on time we turned off the runway quickly to reach the stand. Whilst waiting to disembark one of women wore the pilot's jacket as her friend took photographs All the action should be captured on the plane's CCTV. Certainly a different form of in flight entertainment!,Aer Lingus,,1,
1684,,Economy Class,,,no,2,4,,,3,2,Aer Lingus customer review,Sheila Buddle (Ireland) 13th November 2012,unk,Cork-Glasgow route (operated by Aer Arann) on 24th Oct - not a pleasant experience. Flight was 2hrs late leaving - explanation given was the plane was late arriving. Departing Glasgow on 29th Oct was again nearly 2 hrs late (no explanation given on this occasion). Every time I have used this route it is delayed and speaking with other passengers I am not alone! The aircraft is always dirty - coffee spills down the seats/walls seem to be a permanent fixture and added to that the dirty magazines and paper wrappings left behind in the seat pockets. If I had a choice I certainly would not recommend this route to anyone.,Aer Lingus,,,
1685,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,4,3,,5,8,Aer Lingus customer review,Valerio De Ambroggi (Italy) 12th November 2012,unk,Milan - Dublin - New York and back. All the flights were on time at departures and arrived at destination before scheduled. The crew were professional and friendly and the flights uneventful. The A320 have very comfortable seats economy A330 is a bit short of space for long haul flights but inflight entertainment and the service were ok considering the low fare paid.,Aer Lingus,,4,
1686,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,D Cahill (Ireland) 12th November 2012,unk,Alicante to Dublin on 27/10/2012. Although the flight was a little late leaving Alicante due to slow loading of passengers and hand luggage the actual journey was a pleasant experience. I thought all the staff were friendly and courteous. Arriving into Dublin well after midnight all the staff were still smiling and pleasant as passengers disembarked. I will travel again with EI as long as staff continue to smile and look like they care about passengers.,Aer Lingus,,,
1687,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,4,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,Cathy Pettersen (United States) 8th November 2012,unk,We flew United from Seattle to Chicago so was dreading the long flight to Dublin. Flight attendants were nice and helpful and much to my surprise the food wasn't half bad. Comparatively speaking the seats were comfortable; certainly roomier than those on United. Upon boarding each seat had a pillow in it and there were free movies and TV programs to choose from. Landed in Chicago 45 minutes early.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1688,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,5,8,Aer Lingus customer review,D Maher (Ireland) 7th November 2012,unk,Stockholm - Dublin slight delay but comfortable plane and the usual friendly staff. Please Aer Lingus enforce the carry on bag limits it was a full flight and nearly every passenger was hauling on a wheely suitcase. Those of us who had checked in luggage were asked to remove coats and duty free purchases from the overhead bins so that these suitcases could be accommodated which is both annoying and unfair!,Aer Lingus,,,
1689,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,5,8,Aer Lingus customer review,P McCracken (Ireland) 6th November 2012,unk,Dublin - Boston Return. Both flights on time. Great to clear USA immigration in Dublin. Inflight service outbound efficient but staff not as friendly as normal. Inbound staff excellent nothing too much trouble. Inflight entertainment good but on return had to ask for it to be turned on for the whole aircraft. Staff forgot. Then it had to be rebooted. All told took an hour before the IFE was up and running. All flights on time. Seats standard economy seats but comfortable enough. Great to be domestic flight into the USA. Took 15 mins from getting off the aircraft to kerbside.,Aer Lingus,,4,
1690,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,3,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,Alan O'Connor (Ireland) 5th November 2012,unk,DUB-LIN and VRN-DUB - The usual Aer Lingus service. On time clean planes friendly FA's. Quite happy that they are enforcing the carry on luggage rule as planes now get off on time. I don't know why people are complaining about having to pay for food. Most EI flights are 2.5 hours or less. Eat before you leave or else bring your own food and stop complaining. I'm very happy with them and will continue to use them. For the fare you pay (if you book well in advance) I have few complaints about the service.,Aer Lingus,,3,
1691,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,E O'Sullivan (Ireland) 5th November 2012,unk,We were stranded in JFK on 31st Oct after our airline (a large American) had cancelled our flight for the second time as a result of the Super storm Sandy. The only flight they could re-schedule us for was on 8th Nov and the only customer service they offered was a card with a telephone number. We approached the Aer Lingus staff in JFK who despite having no obligation to help us said they would see what they could do. In the end they managed to accommodate us on their flights and got my family back to Dublin The Aer Lingus staff on the day showed customer service at its very best.,Aer Lingus,,5,

While it was a last minute booking I'm afraid the service offered for the £570 I paid for the return ticket was abysmal! Only a short 1hr flight but nothing in the way of service not even a glass of water without having to pay for it. The saving grace was because I bought a full fare Y ticket I was allowed to use the lounge both at Heathrow and Dublin which where ok.,Aer Lingus,,,
1693,,Economy Class,,,no,2,1,1,,2,unk,Aer Lingus customer review,Michael Mertaugh (United States) 1st November 2012,unk,We flew yesterday from Geneva to Dublin. The plane was two hours late; overhead luggage racks were full when we boarded and there were hefty charges for any food or drink aboard the flight. It also took unnecessarily long to serve passengers because the crew had to collect money and discuss food selections from all passengers who wished to eat or drink. There were no charges (yet) to use the toilets.,Aer Lingus,,,
1694,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,,,3,10,Aer Lingus customer review,C McCarthy (United Kingdom) 1st November 2012,unk,Travelled with Aer Lingus Regional (operated by Aer Arann) return from Birmingham to Shannon. Flights early in both directions. flight attendants attentive and friendly. Plane on outward journey was 23 years old! Seats were old and tatty but nonetheless clean and comfortable. Return flight on a modern aircraft which was in immaculate condition. Comfortable leather seats made the journey more endurable and the plane was spotless.,Aer Lingus,,,
1695,,Economy Class,,,no,2,1,,,1,1,Aer Lingus customer review,David O'Sullivan (Ireland) 25th October 2012,unk,EI 638 to Brussels. Fly Aer Lingus about 2 times a month for both business and pleasure. Unfortunately not much pleasure flying with Aer Lingus and getting worse. At the gate there was a team of 5 identifying bags take off passengers and put in the hold. Despite my bag being within guidelines (I have measured it) it was confiscated. I was first told that it was too big when I challenged this I was told that it was a health safety risk and would not fit in the bin. Strange as the same bag has been on about 20 flights with EI. It was rude and humiliating treatment by the staff but based on many reviews here it is a common theme. When I got to my seat there was plenty of space in the bin. Arrived late into Brussels and then had a 40 minute wait for my hand luggage. People will be more forthcoming with bags if they are given back to passengers as they get off the plane - Air France and US carriers have no problems doing this If someone has a problem maybe it is because they have documents laptops etc which they would prefer not to go into the hold for obvious reasons. At this stage I will use Aer Lingus when I have to but if there is any reasonable alternative then I won't and certainly not for leisure flights. As an aside the cost of the flight was in excess of €500.,Aer Lingus,,1,

1697,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,4,,5,9,Aer Lingus customer review,Jordan Patrick (Ireland) 19th October 2012,unk,DUB-CDG Return. A very pleasant trip good service from cabin crew. Slight delay returning due to circumstances outside Aer Lingus control. Catering is paid for but not too expensive. Competitive fares make this route worth considering on Aer Lingus.,Aer Lingus,,,
1698,,Business Class,,,yes,4,4,3,,5,8,Aer Lingus customer review,W Pechler (Netherlands) 12th October 2012,unk,AMS-DUB October 9th and back again October 12th. Both times just after 1PM. No delay on first flight half-hour delay on second but reduced to 20 minutes on arrival. Hand luggage was slightly (about 1 inch) too broad but was never measured or weighed and therefore it wasn't a problem. Both flights about three quarters filled - all single travelers myself included got either a window or aisle seat with the middle seat left clear. Friendly staff and clean planes. On short haul flights no television screens with flight information. Available food on plane very limited. Inflight magazine one of the most boring I've read so far. Good value for money I'd use them again but not for a flight with a layover since (small) delays seem to be common.,Aer Lingus,,1,
1699,,Business Class,,,no,4,3,2,,3,3,Aer Lingus customer review,J Tozer (Australia) 10th October 2012,unk,Budapest to Dublin on a packed flight early September. We were greeted at check in by the advice that wife's bag was 3 kg over and even though we had only one carry on bag well below 7kg no leeway was allowed. Aer Lingus is the only airline we experienced in 15 international flights that has a 20kg (not 23kg) hold baggage limit. To determine whether or not they are value for money I now routinely add $50 (that's what 3kg cost me) to their fares when I compare them. Food was non-existent so it's not easy to rate it.,Aer Lingus,,3,

I travel that route a lot due to work commitments and have rated theirs the best service in the past (compared to rivals Easyjet and Jet2). However the legroom on the Airbus 319 last night was simply dreadful. Ok I'm 6'3"" but have never had such a problem with them before. My knees were jammed into the seat back in front of me and I couldn't get comfortable. 3 hours of that discomfort and I was ready to scream. I checked the website to see how to complain and I have to do it in writing - no email address is provided. How very convenient (for them not a complainant) Add to that the fact that my first two drink choices (none too demanding - a can of Fanta and then a can of Diet Coke ) were sold out and I'm less than impressed. It appears that due to their move from Belfast International to Belfast City airport they're dumping the Alicante route shortly - on the basis of last night's experience I won't miss them.",Aer Lingus,,,

Female Personnel on board from DUB- DUS (not at the terminal) was disinterested to rude the word please was unknown.

A333's between BOS and DUB were clean comfortable and had great entertainment systems. The inflight meal was pretty good for airline food and the service was very good. A320's between DUB and BCN were clean and a little less leg room. They charged for everything including water. When boarding in BCN they weighed our carry on luggage (never had carry ons weighed on any airline ever before including the flight to BCN) one was a bit over so we had to check it at an extra 50 euro.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1704,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,P McDonnell (United States) 23rd September 2012,unk,Flight from DUB-LHR to catch a connecting flight on another airline. Aircraft was clean and comfortable FAs polite and helpful. Flight on time. Only drawback was deplaning at LHR - passengers who were not connecting to another flight exited the aircraft first from the main door onto a jet bridge. Passengers with connecting flights exited last through the rear door down stairs and met a waiting bus. It seemed backwards to make passengers who might have tight connections wait until last to exit. Also since passengers were trying to exit from both the front and rear of the aircraft single-aisle aircraft it was difficult and time consuming for everyone to leave their seat collect their carry on and make their way to the exits. Perhaps this is a restriction coming from the airport rather than Aer Lingus but it seems like something that could be improved.,Aer Lingus,,,
1705,,Economy Class,,,no,5,1,,,1,1,Aer Lingus customer review,J Barrett (United Kingdom) 17th September 2012,unk,We flew from Bournemouth to Dublin. At check in we were told that our bags were too big to go on as hand luggage in spite of the fact that they are the same bags we have always used. We were charged £24 each. This was happening to everyone. Two passengers travelling separately both objected as they had travelled from Dublin to Bournemouth only a couple of days earlier with the same bags as hand luggage. It seems if we had made a scene we would not have been charged $8. Also another passenger on the same flight had a case that would fit under his seat and the steward had to remove it and put it at the back of the plane he was not charged for his bag either. On returning from Dublin to Bournemouth we checked in our bags thinking we had no option other than to pay (there are signs around saying pay up or leave your bags behind) and the check in girl said 'you do not need to check these in they are hand luggage.,Aer Lingus,,,

1710,,Business Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,John Owen (United Kingdom) 29th August 2012,unk,Flew MAN-DUB-BOS-DUB-MAN. Cannot speak too highly of transatlantic sectors. Good time keeping clean cabin for today's airlines reasonable food. IFE was adequate for flight duration. Seat was comfortable enough again for the trip duration. What made Aer Lingus stand out on both transatlantic sectors was the service and efficiency of the cabin crew. My only gripe is the connection in Dublin where all of a sudden from being in a business class environment one has to jostle with other passengers. Perhaps they could look at having a dedicated point such as Swiss do in ZRH. Also the security point staff seemed overwhelmed with the scanner operator having to open bags too. I hasten to suggest that over worked staff can lead to lapses!,Aer Lingus,,4,

The senior cabin crew member on the flight was only interested in selling and was continually annoying passengers on the PA and being in the cabin selling things. Whilst I appreciate the airline and crew make money from revenue I have never seen such a cheap and nasty service offered and something I've never seen or expected of Aer Lingus. It was the most uncomfortable flight I've been on as the lights were on bright the entire flight home. Other passengers were complaining but the crew were more interested in selling than making it comfortable for passengers. On a positive note the crew out on Saturday 18th were very good and the crew coming home could learn a thing or two from them! Everything else about the trip was smooth but the journey home just completely spoilt it hence the low scores.,Aer Lingus,,,

While I was on vacation Aer Lingus emailed me 6 times to notify me that our connection from ORD to YYC was cancelled but they failed to provide any assistance to get us home. I called their customer service line who offered me a similar flight on a different day but were unable to accommodate our schedule. I asked for a refund for the ORD to YYC portion of the flight which they agreed to but the agent was not able to tell me how much that refund would be. I had to rebook ORD to YYC on my own with a different airline. I will never use Aer Lingus again and I don't recommend it to anyone. Very poor customer service.,Aer Lingus,,2,

All flights were on time A320 nice and clean with leather seats that have head rests. Flight attendants have always been friendly providing excellent service. Check-in at the airport and getting an assigned seat is particularly nice and makes standing in line for boarding unnecessary. Great value for money and I fly with them on every opportunity.,Aer Lingus,,,
1715,,Economy Class,,,no,3,2,,,1,2,Aer Lingus customer review,T Dwyer (Ireland) 2nd August 2012,unk,Flown them on several occasions and every time there seems to be some sort of problem. The most recent - I was flying to Dublin (with Iberia and British Airways) from Central America via Madrid and London. My flight from Madrid to London (on BA) was delayed so I went to Iberia and said I had to get another flight from London. They immediately changed my flight and put me on the earliest flight possible so that I could make my flight free of charge. I arrived in London and made my way as quick as I could to Aer Lingus. I was too late for my bags to go through but there was one more flight. I could change onto that flight for €78. I booked an overpriced €250 round trip from Dublin to London and then missed a flight due to another delayed flight and they wanted to charge me more to take an empty seat on the next flight! The staff member in London was rude with an uncaring attitude. No level of hospitality and kindness. Flight itself was fine - no frills not much better than Ryanair not much worse.,Aer Lingus,,,

Checked in on time for a departure at 13.15 this actually took off at 16.30 for Cork! If somebody had explained that the plane was being diverted to Cork and we were then being bussed back to Waterford we would have made alternative arrangements. When we were given our £3 lunch voucher we were told that our flight was in Cork. No mention that our flight was being diverted to Cork as well. When we arrived at Cork there was nobody to guide us to the baggage it was not labelled we eventually found the bus!

Our original flights to Italy experienced minor delays but our return trip from Naples Italy was horrendous. We were delayed multiple times with no explanation. No Aer Lingus employee ever came to the Gate to explain what was going on. We were not offered the opportunity to fly on another airline and by the time we departed we missed our connection in Dublin and were forced to stay overnight in Dublin causing me to miss a critical business meeting. Additionally staff in Dublin ""accidentally"" booked us on flights (through London Heathrow) with another overnight layover. I did not discover this until we were in out hotel room in Dublin purely by accident because we were not issued tickets just handed a computer printout and told we were on flights to JFK in the morning. That night after discovering the error I found a United flight direct to Newark NJ and asked to be booked on that instead which I was ""allowed"" to do. This was the first time I encountered someone helpful at Aer Lingus. Now rebooked on a direct flight the next morning to Newark NJ at my request. To compound the experience the flight from Dublin was delayed 2 hours.",Aer Lingus,,4,

The regional flight was on time with quite poor legroom but we arrived early in Dublin. We changed terminal on one of the buses. The 11am flight from Dublin to Boston doesn't clear immigration in Dublin but it was no big deal. Non-alcoholic drinks were complimentary but things you had to pay for were obviously overpriced. The crew were pleasant and the entertainment was fine. Overall the flights were very good.,Aer Lingus,,4,

After returned to JFK due to problems with the plane's mechanics we were on the tarmac for 3.5 hours and then it took another 3 hours before we arrived at a hotel to spend the night. The next day we returned to the airport and there were only 2 ticket agents to re-ticket almost 400 passengers. We were given vouchers to use on the plane which we could not use once we got on the plane! We missed our reservation in Shannon and Aer Lingus would not refund this amount. The customer service at the New York Office was just an ineffective as the services we received in the airport.,Aer Lingus,,3,

Flight delayed followed by chaotic approach in prioritising passengers meant we missed our connection by 5 minutes. This would have been avoidable if cabin crew had adhered to its policy of getting connecting flight passengers off first via rear door. Instead we were the last to leave as front door took priority. Very disappointing.,Aer Lingus,,,

Cabin crew very attentive and always checking up to make sure everything is okay and offering more free tea and coffee. Cabin was very clean and bright and quite quiet. IFE had a large range.

There were four of us so I pre-booked seats on Row 3 to ensure that we sat together. Unfortunately the legroom in these seats was much narrower than the rest of the seats. The two male passengers were 6ft 4in and 6ft 2in so you can imagine the uncomfortable journey they had to endure. It would have been preferable not to book seats in advance and take pot luck!,Aer Lingus,,,

1727,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,3,3,,4,7,Aer Lingus customer review,K Donegan (Germany) 2nd July 2012,unk,Most recently SXF-DUB-SXF return. The economy class product its getting better after dipping for a few years. Most of the A320s now seem to have the more comfortable seats with moveable headrests and a little more legroom than before (29 rows now instead of 30 I think). I'm an occasional flyer on this airline maybe half a dozen times a year mostly Spain-Ireland or Germany-Ireland. The staff are still pleasant if less experienced. It's a significant notch above Ryanair in overall product and service and worth a premium (often there is none). Pricing overall is competitive.,Aer Lingus,,,
1728,,Economy Class,,,no,3,2,4,,2,2,Aer Lingus customer review,Nicola Harvey (United Kingdom) 24th June 2012,unk,Shocking late service which the airline knew was running late but instead decided to leave everyone at Gatwick staring at the departure board for half an hour with the - please wait sign on. Unloading and loading of passengers was painfully slow (some passengers haven't yet grasped the need to read the ticket and establish what seat they are in). This is the second time this flight has been delayed and the excuses are somewhat similar. It might be an idea to cut the number of flights if they cannot keep the ones to London Gatwick on time. Very Poor prefer Ryanair. The 15/6/2012 Gatwick to Dublin.,Aer Lingus,,,
1729,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,5,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,George Nobbs (United Kingdom) 17th June 2012,unk,LHR-DUB flight was very well done by all accounts quiet and well maintained.

DUB-LHR flight not brilliant more down to bad luck than anything else on this flight it was more the people I was with that caused aggravation behind me shaking my seat back and forth as if it was a play-thing. This wasn't helped by the person in front of me reclining back so there little room. I am not questioning the plane attendants or cleanliness.,Aer Lingus,,,

They did nothing and appeared to have cared less.,Aer Lingus,,4,
1732,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,5,9,Aer Lingus customer review,J Cousins (United Kingdom) 10th June 2012,unk,BHX-DUB-JFK outbound BOS-DUB-BHX inbound. Outbound: BHX very quiet no queue for check-in all on time A320 clean the seat is fine for such a short flight. At Dublin the transfer was pretty smooth took approx 30 mins to pre-clear US Customs and Immigration. You don't collect and recheck your bag it's checked through and you are shown a picture of it on the belt to confirm it's yours etc. Boarded A330-300 clean tidy good AVO generally a nice plane to be on. Sat in the 2 row mini-cabin at the front quietest flight I've been on. Recaro seat is fairly decent. Food was perfectly edible and the crew were helpful and friendly. Arrived early into JFK bags came within a few mins. Return flight much the same exact plane and seat. 30 mins late boarding but made up most of it - arrived 5 mins late. Transfer was much easier and quicker A330-A320 in 30 mins left ahead of schedule arrived early to BHX and was quickly out of the airport. Overall very happy and I think this will now be my preferred route to the East Coast saves the trek to LHR.,Aer Lingus,,5,

The manager said the next flight was the following day at 9.45pm. When passengers started asking to be put on another flight he said there were too many of us he said there was nothing he could do and finally shouted ""I am not going to answer anymore questions the flight is cancelled and that is that"".

Very good IFE and decent food. The fact that you have to pay for alcohol is a bit annoying but it is becoming the standard in the industry. Clearing customs in Dublin is a great plus. Overall a very good experience.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1738,,Economy Class,,,no,4,2,4,,4,5,Aer Lingus customer review,William O'Mara (Ireland) 29th May 2012,unk,I have not used Aer Lingus for many years because of cost. I recently went from Dublin to New York. Outward journey perfect. Return another matter. I could not book a seat and at JFK I was the very first in line I was handed a boarding card not having been asked if I would like an aisle seat or otherwise. I did ask for the same seat I had on the outward journey if it was available. I was told it was not and handed the boarding card within 10 seconds. The impression I I got was that the lady at the desk did not even look. It will be a while before I use Aer Lingus again.,Aer Lingus,,4,

1741,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,,,5,8,Aer Lingus customer review,C Perman (United Kingdom) 27th May 2012,unk,GLA-DUB-GLA. Very reasonable flights but we did not check-in any bags. Check-in with iPad was simple and straightforward and we breezed through security in both directions. ATR-72 plane was ideal for this short flight. The propellers are a lot louder than a jet plane but the 2x2 seat layout is much more suitable for most travellers than the usual 3x3 you expect on sort haul flights. The planes were comfortable and well maintained and the service both ways was professional and friendly. Overall a perfectly acceptable for the short route with an excellent frequency to Glasgow. Much better value for money than the competition (Ryanair from PIK which is invariably more expensive and less frequent). My only real complaint is the need to bus passengers out to a very remote stand in Dublin.,Aer Lingus,,,
1742,,Business Class,,,yes,4,5,5,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,T Lester (United States) 21st May 2012,unk,LHR-JFK via Dublin. Lounge access at Heathrow and very nice lounge in Dublin - impressive airport. Flight from LHR-DUB was very full and uncomfortable. Flight from DUB was in new and very clean A330 - only 10 passengers in business class. Excellent service and very impressed with the food quality. Seat was comfortable and spacious. All in all a good experience - would not like an overnight flight as the seat was not at all comfortable for sleeping - angled type and impossible to get comfortable in that position - also a bigger pillow than the regular economy version would have been appreciated.,Aer Lingus,,4,

Ground staff were not very good they seated the group in different rows but they handled hand luggage in an efficient elegant and professional way. No room inside the cabin? No problem they check it in for you at no extra cost. One appreciates such details when dealing with a bunch of students and all their souvenir purchases. As for the flight - peaceful even though I could have used some more leg space.,Aer Lingus,,,
1744,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,5,8,Aer Lingus customer review,R D Kivett (United Kingdom) 21st May 2012,unk,BHX-DUB-JFK return. Short flight BHX-DUB was fine. Clean plane friendly attendants but cramped leg space which is fine for such a short flight. I had prepaid for my seat selection but due to aircraft change DUB-JFK I was moved to back of plane. I complained to attendant at gate in DUB who apologised and offered to put me in a window exit seat as there were no other aisles available. I preferred the aisle and so stayed with it which turned out to be fine. FA's are for the most part very friendly except for a couple on the return who were efficient but not really friendly. The best thing is being able to go through customs for the US in Dublin on the way out. No lines and easy to get through. ATR on the way back from DUB-BHX looked very old and not very well taken care of. Overall I liked Aer Lingus and plan to fly them again next time I go to the States.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1745,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,J Milne (United Kingdom) 15th May 2012,unk,DUB-MAD. Airbus A320. Boarded 30 minutes prior to departure and left ahead of schedule. Terminal 2 in Dublin very clean modern and spacious. Cabin crew friendly efficient and professional throughout. Purchased drinks and snacks which were of good quality and sold at reasonable prices. Seats leather and comfortable with acceptable legroom. All in all a good flight. The only negative aspect was Madrid Terminal 1 which is old fashioned and lacked any decent facilities.,Aer Lingus,,,
1746,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,3,4,,3,6,Aer Lingus customer review,Mark Hurter (Switzerland) 11th April 2012,unk,ZRH-DUB-ZRH. Tale of two airlines. Web check-in on the way out went well. Full load but crew was helpful arranging hand luggage. Dealt well with some difficult passengers. Crew professional some very friendly. Check-in machines on the return worked well. Passengers seated in the back where allowed to take big hand luggage with them. Those in the front were not so felt sorry for those who paid even more than for a standard seat as they either had their bags checked in for pick up or had to store it at the back of the plane. Front two crew members absolutely unmotivated and yelling at passengers. Prices no longer that cheap. Terminal 2 is ok. Flight to Dublin would be a 8. Back would be a 3. Buy onboard choice is good and prices are ok.,Aer Lingus,,,

In all cases this was blamed on technical difficulties with the aircraft - ageing ATR72 turbo props. Today I had a 3hr delay out of Shannon and the Manchester flight was delayed 6 hrs. Very little information and the Aer Lingus information desk was unstaffed most of the time.,Aer Lingus,,1,

Both flights on time and impressed by the cabin staff. The Dublin to Orlando flight was lovely - very nice food and wine(s). Seat - not a flat bed and was very comfortable for sitting for sleeping it was not and I cannot imagine spending a night in it. Our bags were tagged through from GVA-MCO and when we checked in for DUB-MCO flight only 2 could be located. Counter staff went out of their way to locate and re-tag the ""missing"" bag. Pre-clearance for the US was speedy and pleasant. All in all we were very impressed - service and price both right!",Aer Lingus,,,
1749,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,2,3,,3,5,Aer Lingus customer review,J Wood (United Kingdom) 1st April 2012,unk,I fly twice a week LHR-DUB. Generally acceptable but quite average. Services mostly on time and the journeys smooth. The Aer Lingus Dublin lounge is very pleasant and the staff helpful. Many cabin staff have an unpleasant attitude that suggests we should be thanking them for giving us the opportunity to fly with them - we expect to be treated with at least a bit of respect! The loyalty scheme is not great - they will not provide points for basic non-flexible flights.,Aer Lingus,,1,
1750,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,5,,5,9,Aer Lingus customer review,D Goss (Ireland) 1st April 2012,unk,DUB-TFS-DUB. Great airline to fly with when travelling with children. Flight attendants seem to make even more of an effort with them. Like the look of their new inflight menu and what we bought onboard was tasty. T2 is a pleasure compared to what DUB was previously.,Aer Lingus,,,
1751,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,3,3,,5,6,Aer Lingus customer review,D Olsson (Spain) 20th March 2012,unk,MAD-IAD. Good value for money a step up on the appalling service that we expect from the legacy US carriers but pretty minimal. This is a code share with United and for all intents a United flight in Aer Lingus livery and standard legacy service issues (complimentary and edible meal but you have to pay for alcohol and snack services). A330 was clean and serviceable. Economy had the usual cramped seats. IFE system is good. For the price it is good value.,Aer Lingus,,4,
1752,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,Ian Smith (United Kingdom) 15th March 2012,unk,GLA to ORD via DUB return. The flight to Dublin was with Aer Arann which was fine for the 50 minute flight. Flight to Chicago on A330-300 and we sat in a small three row cabin just behind business class which was excellent. Crew were friendly and professional and the meal was standard economy fare. Only one bar run so if you wanted wine with your meal you had to purchase it. The return flight was only 6.5 hours which was great and the catering was very tasty. Overall a very good product by Aer Lingus.,Aer Lingus,,3,
1753,,Business Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,5,9,Aer Lingus customer review,Colin Boakes (United Kingdom) 23rd February 2012,unk,We are frequent business class travellers this was our first time with Aer Lingus from LHR to MCO via DUB. The whole experience was excellent. Crew were professional but friendly seats comfortable the food delicious and choice of wines good. Given the price we paid - roughly half that of the other airlines we generally use - the service represents great value for money. A shame they don't offer business class on European services but we were still able to use their lounges at LHR and DUB.,Aer Lingus,,4,
1754,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,5,9,Aer Lingus customer review,J Fox (Ireland) 20th February 2012,unk,Dublin-Budapest return. Very organised and efficient boarding with on-time departure from DUB. Smooth flight and early arrival into BUD. Cabin crew courteous although a little functional. Return flight delayed 40 minutes. Pilot and crew apologetic for delay. Plenty of information given on routing arrival and weather. Cabin crew were friendly and accommodating. Problems with excessive hand-luggage is regular on this flight but this was dealt with at check-in and by onboard crew efficiently.,Aer Lingus,,,
1755,,Economy Class,,,no,4,1,,,2,5,Aer Lingus customer review,D O'Sullivan (Ireland) 25th January 2012,unk,BRU to DUB. As a regular flyer with Aer Lingus (Gold Circle Prestige) it is with regret that despite improvements in some areas (e.g. improved lounge) Aer Lingus has difficulty differentiating itself with its competitor Ryanair and passengers are not always the highest priority. Despite a stated policy allowing a cabin case and a personal item such as a laptop bag Aer Lingus has not communicated this to ground crew which led to a poor experience. It is not acceptable for a passenger to be castigated for exceeding the luggage limit when in fact this is not the case. It is also standard practice with other airlines that bags taken from passengers due to lack of space can be collected at the door of the plane rather than at the baggage belt - this is crucial when transfers are involved. Another recent trend is that the seat belt sign is left on until service is completed - a benefit for crew and cabin service rather than passenger comfort. Aside from these issues the flight crews have been generally pleasant on recent trips and 7 out of my last ten flights have been on time although thankfully I had built in enough time to make transfer flights.,Aer Lingus,,,
1756,,Economy Class,,,no,3,5,4,,4,5,Aer Lingus customer review,I Cairns (Ireland) 11th January 2012,unk,Use Aer Lingus for European flights about 5 times a year. We have found that over the last year or two their planes are filthy the seats food-trays and seat-pockets are sticky and dirty every time we travel. We have always used Aer Lingus when possible and have found the service pricing and onboard staff to be excellent but the poor cleanliness is really letting them down. I can't understand why they are letting this area slip so badly.,Aer Lingus,,,
1757,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,3,,5,8,Aer Lingus customer review,J Depaepe (Belgium) 20th December 2011,unk,BRU-DUB-BRU. Airbus A320. Both flights on time. New planes with decent seat pitch.

1758,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,3,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,C Bulman (Ireland) 16th December 2011,unk,Dublin to JFK November 2011. Boarded Airbus A330 on time staff both pleasant and efficient ensuring a quick boarding had seat just behind bulkhead for business class. This area contains 12 or 14 seats and is worth paying extra for - comfortable and entertainment excellent. The flight was nice crew keeping us informed on route and weather etc meals passable at best! However on par with most other carriers from my experience overall a nice flight and felt well looked after.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1759,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,M Davis (Ireland) 14th December 2011,unk,Several day return flights DUB-LHR and DUB-MAN. Quite expensive in most cases as booked quite late but were either not much more expensive than Ryanair or less when you factor in that you would have to pay for priority boarding with Ryanair whereas can book a seat for free on Aer Lingus. But there's no comparison between the two. Very good experience and T2 at Dublin is a fantastic improvement on T1. AL have just launched a new Sky Cafe menu that looks tempting and very well presented although it is a bit misleading to be presenting the full Irish breakfast on bone china when it actually comes in a silver foil tray! Cabin crew without exception very professional and friendly although when I was standing at the back of the cabin waiting to disembark at Manchester it was a bit sad to hear two of them complaining about their jobs. It's not the same as it used to be. But given the choice I would choose AL over any of their competitors out of Dublin.,Aer Lingus,,,
1760,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,I McCracken (United Kingdom) 13th December 2011,unk,BHX-DUB return. I have flown this route with Ryanair and although it is marginally cheaper (£5 or so) Aer Lingus is worth it. Much more comfortable cabin and seats friendly staff and excellent service. Arrived to destination early.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1761,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,M Sharkey (Ireland) 9th December 2011,unk,DUB-MCO. Assisted to the whole family in getting seats at the front of economy class. Dublin is a very clean airport to fly through but I went with Aer Lingus before the big move to terminal 2. Terminal 1 is still very nice. During the flight the cabin crew were nice and food was lovely. All together a lovely flight.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1762,,Economy Class,,,yes,2,5,4,,3,8,Aer Lingus customer review,P O'Flaherty (Ireland) 29th November 2011,unk,DUB-ALC. Flew on an A320 both ways. Very high density and seats tight. Delay of 30 mins both ways. Very friendly staff and actually made you feel that you were important to them as a person not a customer. Food was lovely and landing was extremely smooth as usual.,Aer Lingus,,1,
1763,,Economy Class,,,no,4,2,2,,3,2,Aer Lingus customer review,D Pepin (United States) 22nd November 2011,unk,ORD-Dublin return. Very disappointing experience. On the way to Dublin the flight was nowhere near full but when asked if we could book seats together it was deemed an inconvenience. The flight attendants are not attentive and are inconvenienced if you ask to be served anything other than tea or coffee. The gate personnel on this airline were unwilling to make any accommodations. On the return gate check-in personnel were awful. They were unnecessarily stern and would not bend to make a single accommodation.,Aer Lingus,,5,
1764,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,5,,5,9,Aer Lingus customer review,N Murphy (Ireland) 21st November 2011,unk,Dub to Madrid. Late departure due to passengers trying to take over sized bags onboard. Gate crew did a professional job of trying to take bags from people who should have known better. An almost full flight handled professionally by a competent crew. Nice Hot Irish Breakfast from the Buy on Board menu and regular updates from Captain during the trip. A great mid way service in terms of getting what you pay for with the care from the crew equivalent to that of any full service airline.,Aer Lingus,,,
1765,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,5,4,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,Alan O'Connor (Ireland) 7th November 2011,unk,DUB-LIN and BLQ-DUB. M Wickham's comments re: Venice are interesting. I had the same experience flying back from Bologna where the captain made reference to problems on the ground. Took an age to get people to the gate and onto the buses to the plane. No reason for it. Just typical Italian laid back attitude. Still made up time on the way back and only ended up 5 mins late. Both flights were fine on time clean aircraft and friendly FA's.,Aer Lingus,,,
1766,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,5,8,Aer Lingus customer review,M Wickham (Ireland) 3rd November 2011,unk,DUB-VCE-DUB. Outward flight punctual but return over 1 hr late departing. The pilot said that the reason for the delay was a 'long story' and that he didn't want to go into blame mode whilst heavily hinting at service agent problems in Venice. Pilots informative during the flights and cabin crew helpful.,Aer Lingus,,,
1767,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,5,8,Aer Lingus customer review,A O'Brien (Ireland) 2nd November 2011,unk,DUB-BCN-DUB. Flights on time crew professional and courteous seat pitch good. Dublin departure from Terminal 1 which was a 10 min walk from security at T2 and the flight to DUB left BCN from the far end of the terminal there - so another 10min or so walk.,Aer Lingus,,,
1768,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,3,,5,8,Aer Lingus customer review,H Druce (United States) 1st November 2011,unk,JFK-DUB-MAN return. Staff were friendly and helpful. Flights on time or early. Food typical airline quality but edible. I ordered vegetarian special which were delivered. A330-300 clean and adequate space and comfortable seat. The movies offered adequate variety. Only downside I was told that I needed to be at MAN 3.5hrs before departure. I called both the airline and the airport and was assured that this was necessary and check-in would be open at this early hour. So I was not thrilled to arrive at the airport to have to wait for 1hr before the desk opened. US Customs clearance and transiting in Dublin was easy but a lot of walking involved. I would highly recommend Aer Lingus. My fare was $500 cheaper than the best competitor on the same dates.,Aer Lingus,,4,
1769,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,5,10,Aer Lingus customer review,Peter Thyne (United States) 26th October 2011,unk,JFK-DUB-LGW return Y Class. Purchased emergency exit seats for transatlantic sectors. Seats comfortable with extra legroom and FA on JFK-DUB supplied additional blankets. Food simple but adequate service charming and caring. Three hour delay at JFK so missed connection to LGW impressed with EI's handling and were rebooked on next flights while in the air new boarding cards with breakfast vouchers awaiting our arrival at DUB.,Aer Lingus,,,
1770,,Economy Class,,,no,4,2,3,,5,5,Aer Lingus customer review,David McLaughlan (United Kingdom) 26th October 2011,unk,Glasgow-JFK via Dublin. All flights on time and clearing US customs and border protection in Dublin was an unexpected bonus. The seats and inflight entertainment was above average. However the bar service was only offered once during a 7.5 hour flight. I asked the stewardess if the drinks trolley would be making another appearance or if I could purchase a beer and she told me I could just have tea or coffee.,Aer Lingus,,4,
1771,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,T Rothe (United States) 20th October 2011,unk,ORD-DUB-CDG A330 ORD-DUB A320 DUB-CDG. Aircraft clean and bright. Transfer at DUB smooth and easy. FA's ORD-DUB were curt but efficient. Food acceptable but not as good as other European carriers. ORD-DUB we were served a small snack (pretzels) dinner and a croissant sandwich. There is only one beverage plus coffee/tea service on international flights and alcohol must be purchased. DUB-CDG there is no complimentary beverage or meal/snack service (all may be purchased). DUB-ORD also went well - FA's much more attentive and friendly. Beware that Aer Lingus has lower baggage-weight allowance than most carriers - only 23kg for long-haul flights. I ordered vegetarian meals (ON AerLingus.com) but FA's on the first flight said that they had no record of this request. I reminded the gate agent on the last leg of my trip but I was again told that there was no record of my request on the return trip.,Aer Lingus,,,
1772,,Economy Class,,,no,,,,,1,1,Aer Lingus customer review,Graham Watkins (United Kingdom) 12th October 2011,unk,Just spent half a day booking a simple flight from Cardiff to Dublin. The on line booking seemed simple until I tried to add and pay the £24 extra for a checked piece of luggage. What a joke and a waste of my time. The call centre operator eventually sorted my problem out but I have been left with a very negative view of 'Cheepo' airlines. The system is misleading since I did not realise there was extra to pay until after the booking was made. All pretty rubbish really. Let's hope the flight is not as poor.,Aer Lingus,,,
1773,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,Chris Colville (United Kingdom) 12th October 2011,unk,BFS-LHR-BFS A320. Fully boarded 20 mins before departure on return leg so efficient turn around. Crew friendly and pretty decent service on both legs. Both legs busy - 19.20 from LHR full on return leg. Looks like EI are doing well on this route but have still reduced to 3 flights a day for winter.,Aer Lingus,,,
1774,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,Tony McLaughlin (United Kingdom) 9th October 2011,unk,LHR-BFS-LHR A320 with decent legroom. Friendly crews. For return leg the inbound flight was delayed 15 minutes (Heathrow and weather). However a very quick turnaround and boarding by front and rear steps rather than the usual seat row number system.,Aer Lingus,,,
1775,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,R Mcgrath (Ireland) 2nd October 2011,unk,Travel Dublin to London every week. The aircraft's are comfortable the food choice good and the cabin crew professional and friendly. Gold circle lounges are well stocked. The only complaint I would have is if you are on a flight after 18.00 out of Dub there is normally a member of staff mopping the floor something I feel should be saved for after the lounge is closed.,Aer Lingus,,,
1776,,Business Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,L McCourt (United Kingdom) 2nd October 2011,unk,GLA-DUB-ORL return. Service was great and I really liked the seats. Food was good and for the price an excellent service. Would use again. A word of caution Dublin airport is very confusing. The US pre-clearance is excellent but you cannot return to the lounge and we didn't appreciate this.,Aer Lingus,,,
1777,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,T Warren (United Kingdom) 30th September 2011,unk,LGW-Malaga return Economy. Booked online so downloaded my boarding pass 24 hours before flight which with only hand luggage made things simple and fast at Gatwick. Plane was A320 clean tidy and staff were friendly and helpful. Onboard food and drinks were quite expensive seats surprisingly wide and comfortable flight took off and landed on time. Return flight was hampered by not being able to download my boarding pass so no fast track  I had to queue at Malaga for over 1 hr and the flight was delayed for 30 mins but because of tailwinds we arrived at Gatwick 10 mins early.,Aer Lingus,,,
1778,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,Mark Barker (United Kingdom) 24th September 2011,unk,MAN to DUB then onto Boston return in Economy. A330/A320 both on time.

1779,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,C Yap (United States) 15th September 2011,unk,BOS-DUB and DUB-AMS. Flew A330/A320. Found the flights professional. FA fairly friendly and attended to needs. Had one get me warm milk for my baby whilst another did not return with an ice cup. Meals okay on first flight need to pay for the second. Baggage free for one luggage second flight was part of KLM codeshare and also free. Planes clean and arrived on time. A330 arm rests did not recline fully so difficult to lie flat.,Aer Lingus,,,
1780,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,1,8,Aer Lingus customer review,Hong Cao Minh (Vietnam) 14th September 2011,unk,Amsterdam-Dublin and Malaga-London Gatwick. Staff have been professional and polite although I noticed some of the staff do not have English as their first language and could try harder to communicate more efficiently. One all of the flights I took departure was roughly on time and although in the budget category of airline Aer Lingus offers a good alternative to the more expensive carriers. I do not like the policy of charging for bags and found the website rather unfriendly - the latter is my only real concern. The new terminal in Dublin is very welcoming too. As a non-EU citizen the process of gaining UK and Irish tourism visas was hard and the Schengen visa regime is also very complex and appears to be applied in a random manner. Although not the fault of check-in staff more information should be provided to the staff to enable them to more politely deal with non-EU customers when checking in for flights.,Aer Lingus,,,
1781,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,M Linnie (United Kingdom) 13th September 2011,unk,Dublin to Barcelona return. Had to get up at 3 in the morning for the 6.40 flight to Barcelona for a cruise. Terminal 2 at Dublin is very spacious and modern but unfortunately we found ourselves taking a long walk over to T1 for our flight. Very nice flight food was lovely - I recommend if you are flying in the morning to get the Irish Fry. Staff were friendly except for one person who was a bit rude but all in all a nice flight which landed 10 mins early. Same story returning but there was a delay at check-in at Barcelona because there was something wrong with the toe for the bags but when walking to security we passed a new modern and deserted check-in area not in use. Other than that 2 nice on time flights.,Aer Lingus,,,
1782,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,S Potts (Netherlands) 12th September 2011,unk,AMS-ORK in A320s. Both flights were on time and the cabin crew friendly. In this respect they exceeded my expectations. The planes looked relatively new although on the return trip the cleaners seemed to have missed areas. The range of food/drink for purchase is excellent although the alcohol is expensive for what you get. The only real complaint is the horrible departure times they offer on this route.,Aer Lingus,,,
1783,,Business Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,P Cartwright (United Kingdom) 12th September 2011,unk,EDI-DUB-MCO return. All flights on time on all sectors of the journey. Flying Business Class has access to the Aer Lingus lounge in Dublin. Comfortable seating areas with the usual selection of snacks and drinks. Pre-clearance into the USA is an absolute positive if you fly via Dublin as once you arrive in the USA you pick up your bags and you're all set to go. Inflight service was excellent both ways. Attentive cabin crew who seemed genuinely happy to greet you. Pre-flight drinks were followed by hot and cold canapés and a substantial 3 course meal. Cabin crew continually topped up wine and water glasses without request. Seats are great in recline position and my only minor criticism would be that the flat bed is at an angle. Feels like you're about to slip of the seat however this is only a minor complaint in terms of the great service provided. If you compare the price of business class with other airlines flying to Orlando this is a great ticket especially if you book in advance.,Aer Lingus,,,
1784,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,Michael O'Connell (Ireland) 10th September 2011,unk,Cork to London Heathrow return. Once again a professional and friendly service provided both flights on time good selection of food and drink for sale. There seems to be an improvement in service over recent years offering great value for money and a decent quality of service.,Aer Lingus,,,
1785,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,J Burgess (United Kingdom) 8th September 2011,unk,Manchester to JFK via Dublin. Flight from Manchester to Dublin was delayed for 1 hr through no fault of Aer Lingus. They held the plane for us at Dublin and as soon as we arrived we were personally ushered straight through passport control and US customs. I was impressed the flight attendants friendly and helpful the food good and the inflight entertainment was excellent.,Aer Lingus,,,
1786,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,7,Aer Lingus customer review,C Watson (Switzerland) 5th September 2011,unk,DUB-GVA one way. Smooth Terminal 2 less hassle at check-in airport check-in machines instead of printing your own boarding pass etc. It was a nice relaxed flight on time and the queues were fast-moving. It's not quite the level of other carriers but the premium you're paying for is smoothness and calm.,Aer Lingus,,,
1787,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,Derek Lightfoot (United Kingdom) 29th August 2011,unk,DUB to BOS return in Economy. Both flights on A330 and both left and arrived on schedule. Staff friendly and efficient and the food was ok. Seat back TV's gave plenty of personal entertainment although the touch screen was not very responsive and you could feel the person behind you giving their screen a good hard press. I didn't find the seat particularly comfortable but ok for a short-ish transatlantic flight. Dublin airport was good my only complaint being that we didn't pre-clear customs in Dublin. Boston immigration was as usual a disgrace. We were near the front of the queue and still took more than 30mins to clear.,Aer Lingus,,,
1788,,Business Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,J Butler (Ireland) 29th August 2011,unk,DUB-ORD in Business Class. Excellent service once again - provided by professional and attentive cabin crew throughout the flight. The onboard dining experience was just perfect. IFE options have been updated in the past twelve months and are very broad. All luggage arrived promptly at ORD and we were out of the terminal within 20 minutes of landing.,Aer Lingus,,,
1789,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,P McCracken (Ireland) 24th August 2011,unk,Dublin-Boston return. Enjoyed the new seats and IFE on demand. Aircraft clean and in good condition. Outward cabin crew friendly and professional. Food typical economy fare but edible. Return cabin crew friendly but a little rushed due to shortness of flight under 5 hrs. Only gripe is the pricing of alcoholic drinks. Pre-clearance of American immigration and customs in Dublin a major bonus. 15 mins from plane to bus out of Boston airport.,Aer Lingus,,,
1790,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,Yevheniy Kahanovych (Ukraine) 22nd August 2011,unk,LGW-DUB return. Online booking worked fine and was convenient. I didn't book any bag so got 2 flights for a very fair price at short notice. £10 seat surcharge looked unavoidable and wasn't fairly explained as optional. Printed my boarding pass at home and breezed through the airport. Pre-clearance at the gate was done professionally as well as onboard welcome. Plane was tidy uncomfortable seats with not enough legroom. Service was professional however food and drink offerings looked pricey. It didn't matter as flight time was just 45 mins. Return flight was about the same both flights on time. Good value for money. Seat improvement would be appreciated.,Aer Lingus,,,
1791,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,Brian Lally (United States) 22nd August 2011,unk,Boston to Shannon recently. The service was excellent flight attendants were warm and pleasant. The food was very good along with the wines. I will continue to fly Aer Lingus.,Aer Lingus,,,
1792,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,J Slater (United States) 17th August 2011,unk,Chicago to Dublin return in Economy. Orderly boarding in Chicago for a full flight. Friendly and efficient cabin crew who were nicely presented. A lot of babies and small children on this flight but it was nice to see they helped families get settled quickly. Food good quality and lots of water runs during the night. Seatback entertainment very good. Immigration and baggage all fast at Dublin.,Aer Lingus,,,
1793,,Economy Class,,,no,,,,,1,2,Aer Lingus customer review,P Smith (United Kingdom) 16th August 2011,unk,The trip did not live up to expectations. On line seat selection is free 30 hrs before travel so opted for this to save time at the airport. Onboard the aircraft staff were surly and struggled to smile. They enforced safety rules and procedures with an iron fist. One business man was immediately reprimanded for standing and stowing his jacket as the main door had been closed. Seat belts were worn and tatty. All announcements from the cabin crew were rushed making them hard to understand. The only advantage I can see is the use of T2 at Dublin airport.,Aer Lingus,,,
1794,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,J Smith (United Kingdom) 14th August 2011,unk,Dublin-Chicago and on to PDX return. I was on my own with a 22 month old I hadn't bought my child a seat so she was supposed to sit in my lap. However flights were half empty so she got her own seat which was great. Planes were generally clean and in good condition - great seat back entertainment (330). Flight attendants were helpful and attentive. One flight was delayed an hour lots of communication provided.,Aer Lingus,,,
1795,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,D O'Sullivan (Ireland) 9th August 2011,unk,I have had 12 return flights this year to the US Brussels London and Amsterdam. The move to T2 in Dublin has resulted in a great product. Ground staff in Dublin are great giving some recognition to Gold Circle members is welcome. However we have encountered some inconsistencies/lack of professionalism from some crew. I am confident these minor issues can be resolved. Overall the product is improving.,Aer Lingus,,,
1796,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,John Breen (Ireland) 9th August 2011,unk,Dublin to Faro outward flight left slightly late however time was made up in the air. Both flights full cabin crew couldn't do enough for you.,Aer Lingus,,,
1797,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,Michael Burlington (Ireland) 9th August 2011,unk,Cork to LHR return. Flights left on time friendly crew on both sectors good selection of food and drinks for sale at reasonable prices cabin fresh and clean.,Aer Lingus,,,
1798,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,J Waugh (United Kingdom) 8th August 2011,unk,Edinburgh for a flight to Dublin to connect to JFK return. The cabin crew on all flights were very good. Outbound staff were friendly and professional and nothing was a problem. Very informative about New York and places of interest. Excellent service. Return flight also excellent.,Aer Lingus,,,
1799,,Business Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,P Daintry (United States) 7th August 2011,unk,Business class with my son service was wonderful. The seat was comfortable and food was very nice. I lost my bracelet down the back of the seat and the stewardess was on her hands and knees looking for it she couldn't reach it and 5 minutes after landing in Dublin a maintenance worker came on board took the seat apart and retrieved my bracelet.,Aer Lingus,,,
1800,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,G Schmitt (United States) 5th August 2011,unk,After booking at such a low fare I was a bit worried but my fears were unfounded. We boarded a very well maintained new Boeing 757 in Chicago for our trip to Dublin and Amsterdam. Two good quality hot airline meals individual LCD flat panels on each seat back with free movies shows and navigation displays. When our departure in Chicago was delayed due to a thunderstorm Aer Lingus held our connecting flight in Dublin and an employee personally escorted us at Dublin airport to make sure we made our connection.,Aer Lingus,,,
1801,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,K Bourke (Ireland) 31st July 2011,unk,Dublin-Berlin return. Found T2 to be a great improvement in Dublin made a great difference. Flights on time and crew on both flights friendly and a genuine interest in passengers. If you are flying Aer Lingus on an early morning flight I recommend you try their full Irish Breakfast. Aircraft clean and comfortable and was given an exit-row on the return which was great.,Aer Lingus,,,
1802,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,Mike Hall (United Kingdom) 29th July 2011,unk,LHR to Belfast International and they were fine and efficient. Beware of feeling forced to pay for a particular seat on their website though. They give you the impression you have no choice but to pay extra to select a seat. Just wait till online check-in opens and pick the seats you need and save £10s.,Aer Lingus,,,
1803,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,Charles Moffett (United Kingdom) 28th July 2011,unk,Travelled to Faro and returned to Belfast. Staff where great and the flight was on time with very comfortable seating. I travel back and forward to Great Britain on a regular basis and also to Europe and Canada I will try and book Air Lingus when possible.,Aer Lingus,,,
1804,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,M Davis (Ireland) 21st July 2011,unk,Dublin to JFK Gatwick Athens Warsaw and Krakow over the past year with Aer Lingus. Good solid service as usual despite some short delays. Aircraft are generally very clean and comfortable. Vast improvement and consistency in the entertainment system on the A330s since I last flew on one. Also had to cancel a couple of flights to Gatwick and the tax element of the fare was credited back within a couple of days. I called British Airways three times a couple of years ago for the same reason and I'm still waiting. Although AL have pitched themselves in a certain position to compete with the dreadful Ryanair their service is much more consistent than other so- called full service carriers who promise the earth but often fall short.,Aer Lingus,,,
1805,,Business Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,Matt Ayre (United Kingdom) 20th July 2011,unk,Flew to Boston from Heathrow via Dublin and back. The service was very warm and the food delicious. Nothing was to much trouble for the crew and met all our requirements. The only drawback was the comfort of the seat. In whatever position the seat was in I just couldn't get comfortable. The other good point with flying via Dublin is clearing US Immigration and Customs prior to departure and landing into the US as a domestic passenger.,Aer Lingus,,,
1806,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,James Killen (Ireland) 20th July 2011,unk,DUB-JFK-DUB. Efficient check-in. Outbound flight delayed due to large numbers waiting to clear US Immigration/Customs at Dublin. On the flight the menu choice was chicken pasta or beef pasta now that you clear US customs and immigration in Dublin disembarkation at JFK was swift. The return flight left a few mins early and arrived into Dublin 45 mins ahead of time. The food was better than on the outward trip and the crew were friendly good humoured and helpful.,Aer Lingus,,,
1807,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,David Cullinane (Ireland) 18th July 2011,unk,DUB-LGW-DUB. Single class flight. Online check in easy as usual. SMS to remind me of my flight details a helpful new addition. New Terminal 2 a huge improvement on the old Dublin terminal. Security swift on the early morning rush. Gold Circle Lounge a huge improvement on the old one. Good choice of snacks and food. Flight left on time and efficient boarding with alot of connecting passengers from the US. Cabin Crew friendly and efficient. LGW easy exit but need to remember to have boarding pass ready to avoid passport control on fast domestic / ROI exit. Returning that evening long and inefficient on the queues if a lady is being searched on the opposite side of the X- ray why not call through the 8 gents waiting to go through. LGW should be excellent when finished but inefficient security a problem. Delay on flight on return but efficient boarding and flight. Again the crew were excellent. Arrival into Dublin excellent and to my car within 10 mins of getting off of the plane. Will use again.,Aer Lingus,,,
1808,,Business Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,C Woods (Ireland) 18th July 2011,unk,JFK-Dublin. Business Class. Return leg of previous review. Efficient boarding at JFK for what was a very full flight. Great Cabin crew who did a nice meal service that wasn't too rushed but not too lengthy either giving passengers who to get some sleep the opportunity. Good Cabin Crew presence throughout the night and they certainly kept the galley noise to a minimum which was much appreciated. Slept well for 4 hrs straight and crew served a very tasty breakfast an hour out of Dublin. Priority bags out very quickly for Dublin anyway and customs a breeze. Can't fault Aer Lingus on this flight they seem to be getting the balance just right on the LCC model. Business Class fares very competitive on this route.,Aer Lingus,,,
1809,,Economy Class,,,no,,,,,1,1,Aer Lingus customer review,P Keogh (Ireland) 17th July 2011,unk,Dub-Orlando. What a poor effort by Aer Lingus. Entertainment systems on flights over and back kept breaking down so whole system had to keep getting rebooted. Kids were served one drink the whole flight then tea or coffee 45 mins before landing.,Aer Lingus,,,
1810,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,G Calafiore (Australia) 13th July 2011,unk,LHR-BFS-LHR. Arrived at check-in and found a queue that stretched all the way back to Zone A (the entire length of the check-in hall). After some time waiting I and another passenger in fear of missing the bag drop cutoff for our flight left our positions and went to in search of somebody from Aer Lingus at the check-in desks. It was then a race for our flight. Narrow claustrophobic corridors and even narrower aerobridges. EI I suppose can't be held totally responsible for the terminal area assigned them by BAA or probably even the number of counters they can open but I think they could have been a little more pro-active in providing a queue host rather than wait to be prompted by waiting pax in the queue. On the return check in at BFS was smooth no queues at -90mins and despite late arrival of the inbound aircraft we left only 5 mins late. On board both flights were unspectacular and the crew polite and efficient. Although I miss the days when EI was a full-service airline and a member of oneworld they have carried off their transition to a LC carrier successfully. Their website and all rules are simple and clear and there is no ambiguity. If you want extras you pay for them and you get them if not you don't. Simple. We wanted transportation from A to B with one bag which we made sure was under 20kg followed their rules and that's what we got. Easy.,Aer Lingus,,,
1811,,Business Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,C Woods (Ireland) 12th July 2011,unk,DUB-JFK in Business class. Very impressed with all aspects of the flight. New Gold Circle lounge in Dublin's Terminal 2 is a real improvement on the old lounges. Cabin Crew just first class very friendly and efficient and nothing was too much trouble. With US pre-clearance in Dublin I'm surprised more people aren't using Dublin as a hub for transatlantic flights as the new Terminal is a breeze to get through.,Aer Lingus,,,
1812,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,M Wickham (Ireland) 11th July 2011,unk,DUB-TLS-DUB. Flight out was on time but return delayed by 2 hrs because of technical difficulties on an earlier leg. Both flights were very pleasant and cabin crew friendly and attentive. The problems with recent giant carry-ons seem to have abated but if you are in row 1 you will not have access to the overhead lockers because they are used for flight equipment and crew bags. A bit on the pricey side but all in all a positive experience.,Aer Lingus,,,
1813,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,C Coughlan (Ireland) 8th July 2011,unk,DUB-MAL. Flew to Malaga recently and overall very good service. Plane was an A330 so we had IFE which was good. Plane seemed new and was very clean. The only negative is that they charge €5 for a set of ear phones to use with the IFE. However any normal ones will work so it's fine. I fly Aer Lingus and have always found them safe and reliable.,Aer Lingus,,,
1814,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,7,Aer Lingus customer review,Hugo Stekelenburg (Morocco) 4th July 2011,unk,BRU-DUB-BRU. Flights were full on both ways and since it is a LCC service on European routes completely uneventful. They exaggerate their selling experience onboard which seems like you are in the middle of a snack- bar/shopping mall: the aisle got too busy with attendants moving about with their trollies. A bit annoying when you want to relax. However I do like the Irishness of the experience with the welcoming words in Gaelic and the green/shamrock colours everywhere. It gave me Ireland before landing in Ireland. And the flight attendants were very courteous and worked hard.,Aer Lingus,,,
1815,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,Brian Hill (United Kingdom) 3rd July 2011,unk,Great flights Gatwick-Malaga-Gatwick; no hassle except Aer Lingus check-in has moved from Zone B at LGW but it wasn't reflected on my booking confirmation.,Aer Lingus,,,
1816,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,Anne Perret (United Kingdom) 19th June 2011,unk,Smiling and professional service punctuality comfortable seats with seat allocation  without paying extra like all low costs! I had left my ipod on the plane was recovered by staff and mailed back to me in less than a week. Thanks a lot Aer lingus.,Aer Lingus,,,
1817,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,Alan O'Connor (Ireland) 19th June 2011,unk,DUB-FCO MXP-DUB. Switched from Tues-Mon to avoid the stirke which never took place. No charge for the change which was nice. Both flights good usual professionalism from staff. Got back to find they had finally refunded me for a flight I didn't take because of the snow. They were not obliged to but they did which was nice. Certainly preferable to their main competitor!,Aer Lingus,,,
1818,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,7,Aer Lingus customer review,C McCarthy (United Kingdom) 10th June 2011,unk,Aer Lingus regional (operated by Aer Arann) Birmingham to Shannon. Outward flight delayed 2 hours due to technical fault - information was very poor and we were just left waiting. ATR-72 appeared old but still presentable. Flight was smooth until the descent which was extremely bumpy. Shannon to Manchester 0700 scheduled was delayed 40 minutes due to cabin crew being delayed on the previous days flight and by law are entitled to 12 hours rest. Aircraft of high standard soft leather seats top class service overall and apologies from pilot and cabin crew for the delays.,Aer Lingus,,,
1819,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,J Terry (United States) 7th June 2011,unk,ORD-DUB. Not the best international flight but cabin crew very friendly. We had an elderly passenger become very ill and they tended her with great professionalism and kindness. Planes a bit tired but the overall experience for the price was above average.,Aer Lingus,,,
1820,,Economy Class,,,no,,,,,1,unk,Aer Lingus customer review,Patrick Curren (United States) 1st June 2011,unk,I booked and paid for LAX-Shannon round-trip. Arriving at LAX on Friday they had screwed up my booking and made me fly standby. Their next flight wasn't until Monday so if I didn't get on the plane my vacation would be severely disrupted. Their counter person said he would try to help. He then vanished from the counter not to be seen again when I (thankfully) was boarding the plane. No word of apology from him or anyone else at Aer Lingus. Completely unprofessional.,Aer Lingus,,,
1821,,Economy Class,,,no,,,,,1,3,Aer Lingus customer review,N Blades (United Kingdom) 30th May 2011,unk,"Malaga to Gatwick. Have flown the route a couple of times with Aer Lingus and I think they compare favourably with Easyjet. The plane was clean crew friendly and legroom was greater. One problem though. I had paid for 2 seats but my partner was unable to fly so I had an empty seat next to me. I was asked to give it up so that a father could sit with his young son. This I agreed to do but pointed out to the stewardess that I had in fact paid for the empty seat. ""No problem"" says she ""I'll organise a refund for the unused seat"". She took all the details but I heard nothing. When I contacted customer service (a feat in itself) to follow up I was offered £5 which after several emails was increased to £27.93 when I had paid over £100. I was told that cabin crew have no authority to offer refunds. Certainly won't be prepared to offer my seat again.",Aer Lingus,,,
1822,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,Tony McLaughlin (United Kingdom) 28th May 2011,unk,LHR-BFS-LHR - first time I have flown Aer Lingus since they adopted the low cost model. The only difference between then and now is a lack of business class cabin and food and drink is not free. Still a good experience. Relatively new A320s on this route and a price comparable to EasyJet who serve BFS from LTN. Staff friendly seat pitch adequate and food and drink on sale.,Aer Lingus,,,
1823,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,U Senapati (United Kingdom) 21st May 2011,unk,Chicago-Dublin-Manchester. New A330 good legroom and decent recline. Friendly check-in staff at Chicago O'Hare and cabin staff decent food. Choice in the entertainment system could have been better. Expected free alcoholic drinks on long haul flights but charged for. Baggage handled well. Dublin airport is good - shopping food space etc and immigration staff very helpful.,Aer Lingus,,,
1824,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,Sandra Kelly (United Kingdom) 19th May 2011,unk,NOC-LGW with elderly infirm passenger. Friendly service from Aer Lingus at Knock Airport. They arranged a wheelchair there and then for us (normally have to warn them 48 hours prior) and got us to the plane. After nightmare journeys with Ryanair (never again) to Ireland in the past treating their passengers like animals this was much appreciated.,Aer Lingus,,,
1825,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,10,Aer Lingus customer review,T Birch (United Kingdom) 15th May 2011,unk,Gatwick to Malaga. Excellent flight no delays comfy leather seats 32 inch seat pitch in economy compared to Thomson and Easyjet and it was a cheaper fare. Cabin crew attentive. After inflight sales they advised passengers to use call button if anything was required.,Aer Lingus,,,
1826,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,C Harris (United States) 2nd May 2011,unk,Boston-Shannon-Boston. Plenty of leg room entertainment screens wonderful cabin crew helpful and attentive first bag checked is free. All entertainment free and they feed you as well.,Aer Lingus,,,
1827,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,7,Aer Lingus customer review,B Walberer (United States) 21st April 2011,unk,London Gatwick-Dublin-New York Boston-Dublin-London Gatwick. New A330 on US routes excellent entertainment onboard and good food. Very kind cabin staff. We arrived at Boston airport and our flight to Shannon was delayed for 2 hours so we could not catch the flight from Shannon to London. Aer Lingus staff rebooked our flights from Boston to London via Dublin. The US immigration clearance in Dublin instead of the USA airports were also great.,Aer Lingus,,,
1828,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,7,Aer Lingus customer review,Richard Borst (United States) 12th April 2011,unk,BOS-SNN return. The outgoing flight was OK. I recently had a knee replacement and paid extra for roomier seats. The first set of seats were against the bulkhead and I found I had less room than if I had been in a regular seat where I could stretch my legs out. I did not get the same seats on the return and sat with my wife and daughter in the middle of the plane. I noticed that there was much more room. The food was good in both directions. Cabin staff were pleasant and attentive.,Aer Lingus,,,
1829,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,M Hickey (Ireland) 16th March 2011,unk,Have flown return from ORK to ACE ORK to BCN and ORK to LHR in the past two months on A320. Ground service in Cork can be inconsistent. I was impressed by cabin crew and service provided with a smile. Aer Lingus provide a far superior experience than Ryanair.,Aer Lingus,,,
1830,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,7,Aer Lingus customer review,A Hijmans (Brazil) 15th March 2011,unk,DUB-AMS. Breezy check-in through new T2 in DUB new plane flight on time and non-eventful.,Aer Lingus,,,
1831,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aer Lingus customer review,Alexander Lynch (Ireland) 9th March 2011,unk,DUB-ORD-DUB. Regular traveller on this route and have noticed a steep rise in average fares in the past number of months with no enhancement of service offering. A330s used on USA routes excellent; fantastic personal entertainment systems and comfortable seating however cabin crew are still very inconsistent either helpful and polite or arrogant surly and stroppy. There seems to be no middle ground! Meals and snacks are tasty but very basic and small and there is a charge for alcoholic drinks and newspapers onboard which is very petty on a long- haul flight. Aer Lingus is a quality reliable product and a much better option for transatlantic flights than US-based carriers. The new hub at Dublin Terminal 2 is a fantastic building and represents an excellent transfer/connections facility.,Aer Lingus,,,
1832,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,7,Aer Lingus customer review,A O'Connor (Ireland) 25th February 2011,unk,DUB-FCO and LIN-DUB. LIN-DUB delayed by inconsiderate passengers bringing huge bags on board as carry on luggage and by ineptitude of LINstaff. Aer Lingus needs to get a grip of this. Delayed half an hour as people could not seat themselves as people tried to cram bags that would not fit into overhead cabins.,Aer Lingus,,,
1833,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,5,Aer Lingus customer review,A McFadden (Ireland) 22nd February 2011,unk,DUB-BHX-DUB. Early morning flight to Birmingham using the new T2 fantastic building and a great service from EI ground crew. Outbound crew good but not anywhere near the Aer Lingus standard.

Online booking was simple enough with extras available (seat selection extra baggage lounge access etc) at a reasonable cost after the booking was confirmed. My comments below refer to both the outbound and inbound flights unless otherwise mentioned. Check-in was quick and efficient with friendly staff. Oddly though check-in at Malaga opened just one and a half hours before departure despite their website suggesting that you arrive two and a half hours before. Boarding was pain free and organised with special needs passengers quietly loaded first with assigned seating there was no scrum. Cabin was clean and tidy on an A320 with standard seating and adequate leg room. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive and the in-flight service was relaxed and well performed. A good selection of food and drink was served at an unusually reasonable cost. My bacon baguette was so good I asked for another!

1852,,Business Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Aer Lingus customer review,J Hopkins (United States) 7th September 2010,unk,JFK-DUB-EDI GLA-DUB-JFK. Business class from JFK with a stopover in Dublin and very pleased with the experience. I felt obligated to submit a review since our experience was so positive. Business class seating was very nice as we had the newer aircraft both ways. Seats are angled lie-flat but compared favorably to LH’s Business seats. Fairly decent selection of movies and TV shows although the audio selections weren’t wonderful. Flight Attendants in both directions were very attentive. The food was surprisingly good. We were on the late flight out of JFK so there was supposed to be a light meal service with full breakfast in the morning. We started with tasty canapés followed by an optional cold chicken plate — optional because some people chose to sleep right away. The only disappointment was breakfast as the eggs were overcooked. Dinner on the way back was very good with smoked salmon to start and good beef as a main. Both business class check-ins were very quick and pleasant. The lounge at JFK was very nice and food was actually very good. The only downside was that it was outside of security so we had to make sure to allow enough time after relaxing in the lounge. The lounge at Dublin was very nice although with limited food. We had to deal with two economy class check-ins and flights DUB-EDI and GLA-DUB and both were painless. The agent at GLA checked our bags all the way through to JFK even though the two legs had been booked separately. One bag did not make it to JFK but it was located and delivered the next day. All in all it was a great deal for good business class service. We would definitely do it again on the same routes although we probably wouldn’t want to be in a full economy class plane going from DUB to Athens or Rome.,Aer Lingus,,,

Return the same food not as good but still acceptable and flights on-time. The cabin crew on all flights were very friendly and helpful. Only downside our cases weren't transferred at Dublin and followed on the next flight and delivered to our home the next day - according to staff at BHX this happens regularly with transfers. Not impressed with airport security at Dublin - wife bought a bottle of water at Orlando departure lounge and a very rude and self-important security woman grabbed it out of her hand and threw it in a bin when we arrived. But then within 10 feet of security you can buy another over-priced bottle - what's that all about? She missed the 2 cups of airline water in our hand luggage though!,Aer Lingus,,,

Max Blanck (Italy) 17th July 2017",unk,"✅ Verified Review |  Funchal to Porto Santo. This 10-minutes flight is a true experience. Aero Vip carries out the public service obligation connection between Funchal and the smaller Porto Santo airport located on the island with the same name. The outbound flight was on a vintage (1989) Jetstream 32 turboprop airliner with the return flight being on a slightly older (1987) Jetstream 31. In both cases the safety briefing was carried out by the first officer himself, as the plane does not have any FA on board. The outbound flight left right on time and touched down in PXO just 10/15 minutes later. The plane on the way back arrived late and we left PXO with some 30 minutes of delay, again reaching our destination in slight over 10 minutes. The planes’ interiors are quite worn out but overall the planes gave me the impression of being in a good mechanical shape. If you take this flight to reach the beaches in Porto Santo, as was my case, the whole flight is a really fun and unique retro-experience for aviation enthusiasts which unfortunately comes with a hefty price tag (150 EUR return).

S Gorsey (United Kingdom) 30th January 2022",Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Aeroflot has set high standards of achieving a 5-star airline status and my expectations significantly increased as a result. Positives included a seamless upgrade from Comfort to Business at LHR, good Plaza Premium lounge, very good miles earning vs redeeming ratio. The A350 hard product is phenomenal, especially on a short London route, and the catering on this flight exceeded the expectations (usually poor hot meal, however, the 4 cheese pappardelle was very good). However, there are two drawbacks on Aeroflot. Firstly, I  dislike Aeroflot’s or SVO’s standard practice of parking planes at the literally remotest ramps possible in -6C and with ice covering the stairs. I understand there maybe logistics issues, but doing so to a premium-heavy flight like London and for their most luxurious widebody is just beyond logic. I am observing that the crew service on the A350 / B777 is poorer than on their other planes. It gave me a feeling that the crew were very much undertrained; as a result the service, although efficient, felt very rushed and unpolished.  I still believe that the Aeroflot Business Class is above any of its European counterparts from the overall package size view, and if one manages to upgrade for miles (amazing redemption value) like I often do, then this product is possibly the best business class. However, full-fare paying passengers might be disappointed, because, in addition to a cutting-edge hard product, for such money, you expect a hospitable and personalised staff service beyond the ‘just tick’ attitude.  Overall, is Aeroflot a good airline, yes. Is Aeroflot a 5-star level airline and is its business class worth paying a full fare, no.",Aeroflot Russian Airlines,A350-900,5,3

As tickets for alternative flights were being bought by other people and prices were rising very quickly, the only realistic option was to buy a new ticket from Aeroflot for a date before the closure of borders, and then claim a refund. The price of this new ticket was several times more expensive than the original ticket. Aeroflot have refused to provide a refund for the new ticket. Aeroflot cancelled the flight due to border closure, failed to inform me about it before the border closures, failed to change the date of the flight, and refused to provide a compensation for the new ticket.",Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,

We called multiple times throughout April, May and June and I was promised a refund of the full amount. It was obviously not up to me whether to take that flight or not and it is reasonable to expect a full refund. However refund was never provided. I tried to send multiple messages to the airline’s customer service as well with no response. Last week I tried to call Aeroflot customer service. I had to pay for the international call as there are no representatives in Australia where I live. The customer service was extremely poor. To be honest, I have not encountered such poor attitude in years and it was extremely frustrating. The customer service representative could not properly address any of the issues. She said that the only two options are a voucher and reissuing new ticket. Well, I don’t live in Russia or even Europe so there is absolutely no way I can use these options. The reason why I bought a ticket with Aeroflot was that the transfer time was convenient on my way from Rome to Tokyo, I was not even intending to visit Russia. I explained it and no, nothing she was willing to do, just continued quoting new Russian legislation that came into effect half a year after I bought the ticket! I asked to explain how come I was promised a refund previously and was held waiting for months and months and now it’s not an option. She couldn’t explain. She said I can submit complain through the feedback section. I explained that I have tried to communicate the issue through the feedback section already and not getting any response. She said she can’t help with. Then I asked her to connect me to her supervisor and no, she couldn’t do it for some reason. This is the first time ever I couldn’t speak to a customer service manager or a supervisor. Basically the company just decided to keep my money that I paid, go ahead with it and customer service did not care at all. I just lost a lot of money on the international call without any resolution. This situation is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. Every other airline I booked with that cancelled flights provided me a refund a while ago, despite COVID-19. Understand there are struggles at the moment and I did accept a voucher from an Australian airline because I can use it living in Australia. But I just can't use an Aeroflot voucher. The ticket wasn’t a cheap ticket either and it was refundable and it is outrageous that I can’t get money back for a ticket that was refundable (and I paid a premium for it to be refundable and have an option to receive a refund). I sent another message to the airline following the call and received the same response about vouchers that is pretty much just their copy paste from the customer service templates. The airline does not care about their customers and reputation and is just exploiting COVID-19 situation to hold customers’ cash for as long as possible (if not indefinite).",Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,

I also loved the Sukhoi Superjet (SSJ100) despite all the stories about it. I chose to fly it deliberately, as I wanted to see for myself what it was like. Great little regional commuter. I found it very comfortable inside with ample leg room and a rear toilet that was huge - larger than on some big wide bodies. Plane was also very clean inside.

It then turned out that one of our hard Samsonite suitcases had a hole in it. It was too big to be acceptable and I therefore made a claim to Aeroflot, in accordance with their procedure. They answered me that I should send original documentation to Moscow. I did so, but was careful enough to make copies of everything. A couple of days later they just closed my claim, without any further explanations. After that I have contacted them a large number of times, making new claims referring to the original one and so forth. When they noticed that I did not give up, they tried a new strategy – to not answer. After months of waiting, I contacted them again, and actually got an answer: that they had increased their own handling time, according to the Russian law (they said), with another 30 days. Then it was silent again. Next time I contacted them they told me to make a new claim, since the first one was not treated! When I said I did not want to they referred to the Swedish Aeroflot office, which in turn told me to send the claim to them. But when the Swedish office answered to my claim it was with the information that they would not handle the case. Indeed, I have to communicate with the Moscow office, they told me. Aeroflot clearly have no intention whatsoever to give me any compensation. If you think that your suitcases and luggage is not so much to care for, you could buy a ticket with Aeroflot, but if you have any luggage that has a value you should think more than once - and then use another air flight company.",Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,2,1

Worst experience I've had with an airline. My flight from JFK to SVO, was continually delayed by Aeroflot without explanation. Even though the boarding time was never changed, we boarded over an hour late, then were told to get off after 80 minutes sitting on the plane without any sort of communication from Aeroflot staff about what was happening. They eventually claimed that they were trying to solve ""mechanical issues"" with the plane while we continued to sit on the plane. As I later heard airport staff commenting on, I have no idea why they boarded all of the passengers when they had clearly not solved the issue to begin with. To make matters worse, despite the flight taking off from New York (with many American and English-speaking passengers on board), most of the announcements were only made in Russian. After we got off, we were told that we would need to wait for up to 3 more hours to be notified about the status of our flight. We waited for almost 2 more hours before they canceled the flight - but, in fact, they did not admit to canceling the flight - instead, they claimed to have ""delayed"" the flight for a full 24 hours! Many passengers, myself included, were upset and frustrated, but this was not the end of the complete botching of this flight by Aeroflot. They seemed to have no planned response to this scenario. They herded us all upstairs to claim our luggage, and then had us wait in obscenely long lines to check in with two Aeroflot staff members  to claim an updated ticket for the 24-hour-delayed flight and/or a hotel voucher. After already being delayed for hours, we had to wait on these lines for at least an additional 1-2 hours. The worst part of this whole disaster was that Aeroflot claimed that they were not rebooking anyone's flight because the flight had not technically been canceled, it had been delayed (according to them). Most reasonable airlines release tickets once a flight has been canceled (as this one effectively had been, clearly) so that passengers can rebook on other flights, but Aeroflot was able to get around that by ""delaying"" the flight.  The staff that were handing out the new tickets and hotel vouchers were quite rude and displayed no sympathy for customers who had been treated so poorly by the airline already (I understand they were dealing with many angry customers, but they still could have at least apologized on the behalf of the airline, which they did not). Sure enough, even though I had a program in Tel Aviv that required my presence before the ""delayed"" flight's arrival, Aeroflot would not rebook my flight. I was lucky enough to have a travel agent for this trip, and they were able to demand that Aeroflot rebook my flight to another airline after a lot of frustration on their part, requiring me to rush to another airport after a whole night of no sleep. The entire experience was handled so poorly and unprofessionally from beginning to end that I will never fly with Aeroflot again.",Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,

Requested/demanded to meet supervisor, was told by staff that they were in another building! Finally get into the terminal and then spend next 10 hours at another information desk in the terminal. With 3 kids this was absolutely one of the worst travel experiences, especially since I paid for business class to have the comfort. They finally put us up in one of the worst hotel rooms imaginable (available only at 10pm), with no ability to upgrade (since we were not in the ‘Russian section’ of the hotel). We were finally able to get out of Moscow the following day, 24hrs later. No response from Aeroflot customer service. Don’t expect one. Don’t think they care either.

Only issue with Russian pax who always rush out of plane even before parked and push over the rows ahead (this is where crew should manage order), which causes stuck and safety issues.

On the inbound, used again HKG express city check-in, no upgrade to C for HKG-SVO available (sold out). Flight again ok, relaxing and on time. First drink service before takeoff, hot towels before meals. I wonder why the crew did not offer paid uprage to Premium from Economy class in plane, as the PE load was some 30-40 % both ways on long hauls and this may bring additional gains.

I am a Gold Member of Aeroflot Bonus and have been that several periods during my 11 years membership of the program. It is with disappointment that I note a decline in customer centricity since 2013-2016. Especially the last 2 years the airline have become a “paragraph referring airline”. Instead of being flexible with access to lounges for Gold and Platinum members with one guest (spouse) and child (non-teenager), they follow their rules and deny access in most of the cases. Big difference compared to few years ago. The same rigidity to upgrades to Space Plus in economy class, even with half empty planes. Snacks on short flights (1-3 hours) has been the same boring dark bread sandwich for over a year. When flying 6-8 flights per month, this sandwich loses its attraction after a few months. No variation at all. When addressing these issues to Aeroflot Bonus customer feedback desks, the same mechanical defense explanations appear, stating that “crew is just following rules” and do nothing wrong - or, “thanks for your quality feedback on meals, we will review this”, but nothing happens. Aeroflot until a year ago, was an airline I strongly supported and actually also promoted as much better than the reputation, but my experience in 2017-2019 have been flavored with negative impressions.

Having seen negative reviews, we (two adults, three kids 3-10 yo) decided to leave a review here too because we found the airline was excellent in many aspects. Check-in: no hick-up. It was opened two hours before flight, maybe due to Prague's policy, not airline. We wish the airport/airlines may consider this as we found the immigration at Prague was excruciatingly slow, almost deliberately by the staff who manned the counter. We were asked numerous questions and he perused through each passport very slowly without apparent reason. We made it to the flight a few minutes after boarding time had closed despite being number four to check-in. A few travellers were also late behind us.Thankfully Aeroflot waited for us! Our baggage were checked in all the way to Ho Chi Minh where we collected each of them safely. Food: We requested Muslim food. As the PRG-MOW was below 3 hours, special meal request could not be entertained (Aeroflot's policy). This is an aspect which the airline could improve. We came well-prepared with outside food and were not told off by the steward/ess. Orange juice was particularly nice. From MOW to SGN, we were provided with Muslim meal in a very well-presented boxes. It came with halal certification information booklet by a Russian halal authorisation agency. This is much better than the handwritten or sticker of MOML as in other airlines. Aeroflot scores highly from us for ensuring total confidence over the food that they serve. In flight magazine: They certainly have listened to complaints and we are happy to report that they have an in-flight magazine in English, in addition to the thick Russian one. Good job Aeroflot! We now have Nov and Dec 2018 issues as part of our collection! In flight entertainment: Aeroflot may have the largest selection of movies to watch in addition to excellent games for kids. They also have good selection of local (Soviet and Russian) hits. Every passenger was supplied with earphones. The quality of the screen and audio was excellent. 5. For kids, they received two different sets of bag/toy/stationeries/games for the two legs of travel. Very nice bag that my youngest keeps wearing everyday even after a week off the plane! Very nice touch from the Aeroflot! 6. Cabin crew were polite and gentle enough throughout the flight, at check in counter and when speaking with the kids. Amenities on board were also good including blanket, socks, soft slippers and eyemask on the MOW-SGN. Overall cabin experience was great. The flight was warm, clean and spacious enough with reclining seats, and lift-able armrest, allowing my kids to sleep on my laps. Overall Moscow Sheremetyevo experience was excellent. Immigration was polite and quick. Airport facilities were great. There is even a family room at Terminal D which could be booked for free to up to 24hrs by a family that has at least one <7 yo. It has beds for small kids and sofas for older ones, a playing room, nappy changing room, basic kitchen (for warming baby foods and hot water) and private toilet. It is manned by a personnel who just need to be shown the passports and boarding passes. We used 12 flights for this particular trip, and Aeroflot scored highest.

The IFE had a decent selection of Western films in English and the sound quality was very good, particularly compared to that on some of Aeroflot's other aircraft. Legroom was slightly more than average for economy and the seat wasn't uncomfortable. All in all, I found it very good value for a flight of this length, and got off without feeling cramped or overly tired which is a great bonus.",Aeroflot Russian Airlines,Boeing 777,4,2

Aeroflot is definitely not a premium airline it thinks it is, because their economy experience is simply embarrassing. Moscow - Istanbul was on a 5-year old Boeing 737-800, but the cabin looked like it was 15 years old with no maintenance. Everything was scuffed, slightly teared, shaky etc. The seats were unbelievably, and I mean it, unbelievably tight. It was seriously painful to sit upright in the seat, because if you are of average height, your knees will be firmly pressed into the hard and rough metal bar, which is conveniently located right where your knees are supposed to be. The fact that the armrests were quite wide made the seat even less spacious. I lucked out in not having a neighbour in the next seat, but I seriously doubt it I would have handled the flight if it was 100% full. The cabin crew were grumpy and sloppy (with one exception), and their attitude regarding safety was unbelievable - they just didn't care. They never properly checked the cabin before take off and failed to enforce the safety rules (since they cared so little), so the plane took off with open tray tables, closed windows, passengers laying across the seats with no seatbelts, passengers streaming something from their devices with no headphones. I have never experienced anything like this, I felt like this was a bad dream or a good comedy, but it was neither. The meal service was alright. I ordered a kosher meal, which is always a fine choice on Aeroflot, and it was much bigger than the regular meals. Nothing extraordinary, plastic cutlery, no menus, but it was fine. There was no wine, beer or any other alcohol onboard, not even for purchase, which is just so embarrassing for the ""best airline of Eastern Europe"". I must also note that their main full-service competitors on this route - Turkish Airlines and Atlasglobal - both serve beer and wine, and their meals are much tastier. There was no entertainment onboard. You could apparently stream entertainment via their wi-fi network, but it kept failing. The landing in Istanbul was really rough, and then the plane spent 20 minutes slowly driving through the airport. The passengers thought it was a great time to stand up, open the overhead bins, start packing while the plane was in motion and something could easily fall down on someone's head, and the crew did nothing to stop it. So, once again, major safety hazard. Istanbul-Moscow was another story. It was Boeing 737-800 with the same seating chart, but the plane was newer, and the seats were better. Their design allowed for more legroom, and while it still wasn't spacious, it was tolerable. I still don't get why they decided to have a magazine pocket at the top of the seat (which is a great idea for maximising legroom) and at the knee level as well, because that doesn't make any sense from any perspective and shows poor management, but at least there were no metal bars this time. The seats felt super flimsy and cheap, though, with the whole row shaking and creaking whenever someone moved. I wonder if this plane will age well, because it seems like it will not. Cabin crew were much more pleasant this time around, and they actually made sure the people were seated with their seatbelts on. No wine or beer once again. The kosher meal was exactly the same, which was fine. The flight was delayed for 30 minutes with no explanation or apology. Overall, Aeroflot left a poor impression, and I will make sure to avoid it.",Aeroflot Russian Airlines,Boeing 737-800,2,2

Aeroflot apparently introduced a new dedicated counter for Business Class. So now they process separately Business class, Sky Priority and Economy passengers at the check in. Which might be a good idea at the main Aeroflot airports. However, in Prague it creates a lot of problems, confusions and discomfort. In the past, there was just common Business Class/Sky Priority counter and two for Economy. In this particular case, they checked in all 4 Business class passengers at one counter, 10 SkyPriority passengers at the other counter and all the remaining approx. 150 people at the single, remaining counter. In the past, they had two counters for economy, serving on average. 75 people each. Consequently, the new regime effectively doubled queues (and check in time) for economy passengers, but offered only a very little or no extra comfort for business passengers. Moreover, it disturbed the whole process, because people waiting in a very long queue were continuously trying to sneak in into SkyPriority.

They insisted to move the luggage around even though we could have more. So make sure to pack under each suitcase. The food in flight was delicious, they had sea bass, halibut, beef brisket,etc. Even for 3 or 4 hr flight they served a full meal. However, they serve the drinks first, so don't finish the drinks or ask for 2,if you like drinking during your meals. The movie selection was adequate, the headphones are 2 prong, they only distribute once the plane is in flight so bring your own if you have one. There is a USB charger. People bring pets in the plane, small dogs,etc. The lady next to me wanted to put her dog by my foot, and I refused, they should be made to buy business class for more space, plus she put her dirty, bare foot on the food tray to elevate, which was gross, and she ate there!

However, one can see ""on time"" mark on the timetable. My husband was at that time flying to Moscow from Berlin to catch the same flight. Dut to the weather conditions, I expected the cancellation to happen, but what happened next, demonstrates the complete lack of Aeroflot`s ability to organize the passenger flow in such situations. My husband eventually got stuck in the transit zone with the flight information ""on time"", no Aeroflot personnel and people, who were sleeping on the mattresses! He found an Aeroflot representative only after an hour of running through different terminals of Sheremetyevo airport. At the same time I was literally fighting to get the same-day-flight to Yerevan (2 ladies at the counter for over 200 passengers), while the Aeroflot representative was extremely impolite and borderline offensive. Eventually, I got a flight 3 hours later (which got delayed for 3 more hours), and my husband managed to get a flight 3 hours (plus 1 hour delay) after my delayed flight. Waiting time at Sheremetyevo was more than 10 hours. We could not even fly together. They still had seats but they pointed out that it ""is too difficult for them"". No food or hotel were provided, not even a bottle of water. Anyway, the whole time all I wanted to hear was: ""We are sorry for your inconvenience. Your possible options would be"". That is what I expect instead of misleading information, disrespectful personnel and tricks à la ""how to not provide hotel by stating the wrong time of the flight"". I still hope for an official excuse letter.",Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,

Flight cancellations are not rare occurrences, of course. However, the way Aeroflot handled the cancellation left a lot to be desired. I was notified by my travel agent initially via email and apparently, was extremely shocked. I then phoned the agent but to no avail and given that there was no after-hour support in my region, I called their reservations hotline in Russia, only to find that some of their staff did not even speak comprehensible English. To complicate things, they denied the reservations code they themselves supplied, claiming that there was no numbers but only letters, when it clearly contained 2 numbers! After a rather unproductive 5-minute conversation where the staff kept prompting me to repeat and verify the reference code, they asked me for the ticket number. Guess what? They then forwarded me to another service agent, kind of implying it was a special case and they couldn't handle it. When I was finally connected, I was asked to supply the reference code again and they once again said their reference codes do not contain numbers. Of course, that member of staff also ended up asking me to quote the ticket number and sounded hugely impatient when I said ""hold on let me retrieve it"" with a long and deep breath. Mind you, it took me less than 15 seconds to retrieve it. When I finally started quoting the number, that staff member did not respond until I repeated a few times the first 6 digits and the deafening silence caused me to think the call was interrupted. Yet, after a few ""hellos"" he finally went ""CONTINUE!"" and that was one of the most impolite commands I'd ever encountered in phone conversations with airline personnel! To make things worse, he then said he needed to check my booking details further and put me on hold without even saying anything like ""please hold the line"". After waiting for 20 minutes, the call was disconnected and no one ever rang me back. I had had enough and decided to book myself on another airline.",Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,

There is no ""warm and fuzzy"" feeling from the flight attendents, but they are professional. Boarding the plane is all-at-once, chaotic. Best to be near the front of the boarding line, since Russians have a habit of trying to carry-on everything and the overhead bins fill quickly. Be prepared to board/unboard at Sheremetevo via a stairway on the tarmac after a short bus ride from the terminal. The meal served on both flights was a beef sandwich with cheese, horseradish sauce, and a pickle on dark bread, with a small fruit bar and a mandarin orange. Not great, but for a short flight it was better than most budget airlines. There was a delay out of Sheremetevo for mechanical repairs - While boarding we could see a mechanic tightening lug nuts on the A231's tire.

They told me to take 1kg out or pay 2000rur or they wouldnt let me fly.

There was only 1 person scanning boarding passes for economy passengers with no help and no proper queue so all customers were just pushing to get to the desk to board. This was highly unorganised and not pleasant. We had to board on a bus even though we were flying on a full B777 while smaller A320's and B737's sat at the gate making the boarding process very uncomfortable . The plane was one of Aeroflot's oldest B777's. The USB charger was broken at my seat and one of the toilets was out of order. They hadn't changed the entertainment from April to May even though they provided the May entertainment guide. The food was terrible and they ran out of the food selection I wanted due to the way they were serving food (back to front rows). For breakfast I got a buckwheat porridge however it wasnt a porridge at all, just a tray full of cooked but dry buckwheat. They don't serve any alcohol on an 8hr flight - if you want some you have to pay for it and if you want a snack you also have to pay for it.

Flying domestically in Russia is relatively inexpensive: my ticket was 7000 rubles, roughly 116 USD at the current exchange rate. A similar flight in the US would be 2 to 3 times as expensive and with about the same experience. As always, boarding the plane with Aeroflot is chaotic. Announcements are few, if any. There is no particular order for boarding by zones, so people queue up early. Both flights were at or very near capacity. The flight to Tyumen was uncomfortable, the cabin temperature so warm that I was sweating on the plane. The return flight to Moscow was a little better, but the cabin temperature was still warm. Seats were cramped with very little leg room on this B737-800. Both flights had in-flight meal consisting of a sandwich, small fruit bar, and a mandarin orange, but considering it was only a 2.5 hour flight getting anything in economy/coach is a bonus. The flight attendants were professional but not particularly cordial. Arriving in Moscow Sheremetovo we had to wait in a holding pattern due to a heavy snowstorm, but still landed on time. We had to descend from a mobile platform and board a bus to take us from the tarmack to the terminal, and with the snow it was a bit slippery.

My only reason to write this review is to warn other Skyteam members not to fly with Aeroflot. From booking to flight, aside from the planes being relatively new and a lower price than the poor standard Chinese airlines there is no other reason to fly with them. Despite being a Platinum member I was unable to book any economy comfort seats nor even an exit seat, they are all blocked for Aeroflot members only - and on the London to Moscow leg all the exit seats were empty and we were not allowed to move to them. On the 9.5 hour Beijing leg there are no extra legroom seats as they are only available on the 777's, so you are on an aircraft that most airlines use on medium haul with only 30 inches legroom - the cabin was crammed with people all over the place and as normal rather large people at that with legs in the aisles. Check-in was supposed to start at 7.40 but we waited until 8am whilst listening to the staff stories about the night before whilst they drank their coffee, the start of abysmal service displayed throughout the entire journey. Flight left 1 hour late and then at Moscow was delayed again by 1.15 whilst they de-iced the wings. The food was not only poor it was inedible, and I had the same AVML meal on both legs plus no alcohol at all, and when questioned all I got was a curt ""we never have any"" reply. Why on earth not? There is no religious reason on flights to China and even China Eastern has 2 bottles of red and white. Lounges were typical Eastern European, absolutely packed and with no hot food whatsoever, I managed to find some coleslaw and sweet bread plus some Chilean wine to keep me going as I'd eaten nothing for over 6 hours. Entertainment system was zero on the flight from London, not even a communal TV nor any music, and on the Beijing flight it kept breaking down. At no time did any staff walk around with drinks, there are no snacks available not even noodles and if you press your call button they do not answer.

As ground staff told us the reason of delay was 'late arrival of an aircraft'. As crew told us the reason of delay was 'slow work of ground staff'. Boarding was hectic and not well organised.

However, no detailed explanation, which would have been useful, was given, and the cabin staff did not know the reason, which they should have done, I suspect it was an APU issue, as the cabin was freezing until the engines were started. Nevertheless, the captain managed to reduce the delay to 45 minutes by arrival. One significant advantage of flying Aeroflot is the Moscow airport it uses, Sheremetyevo.

Cabin crew could do with a communication refresher course: on the outbound they were welcoming and friendly, but on the inbound they were devoid of smiles, mechanical with military-like efficiency, and I witnessed some shocking behaviour from one crew member who barked at passengers, even shouting ""chicken or lamb?"" six times to an elderly passenger who clearly could not undertand English.

I had to ask for water twice. Most Airlines supply you with a bottle of water to begin with. Lunch service very long and food portions and quality average at best. Transferring in freezing Moscow (-6c) by bus to the Narita bound aircraft, no special bus for business passengers, its ok by Aeroflot to pay 5000usd per ticket and to sit in a frozen crowded bus for a long time. Onboard a charming welcome as usual, but business seats in the A330-300 too hard, an extra mattress is needed like many other airlines do these days to increase comfort. Dinner service took long (3 hours from take off to finish) leaving us with 6 hours to sleep, but wake up call (optional) for breakfast is 2 hours before landing, leaving passengers to sleep 4 hours or give up breakfast. WiFi for a fee in Business is unreal. Purchased a 10USD package that expired before one site could be up. Waste of money. Didn't use again the whole trip (4 segments). Return NRT-SVO-TLV, the first portion again on A333 but in Economy!

After takeoff I counted at least 10 rows of 4 seaters with one or two passenger at the most. So much for telling the truth. The agent could have blocked the seats between us, and release them for others if need be. For someone who paid so much for those tickets, I expected more cooperation. I asked to check an upgrade fee, but the ticketing agent took over an hour to calculate the difference in fare, but failed to come up with a confirmed rate. We gave up, as we wished to eat and shop, and didnt fancy waiting so long at check in. Was that rocket science task?  Onboard crew less friendly than the usual, seats painfully crowded and very little padding. Food was average again ,most Japanese around me left the food untouched.

You are still not allowed to use any electronic appliances during takeoff and landing though - which is really annoying, especially if other airlines (BA) have long abandoned this restriction. There was no inflight entertainment in the Economy cabin and no WIFI, however that wasn't important for a 3-hour flight. The ground crew is much less impressive though - our flight was 30 minutes late, yet the boarding attendant didn't volunteer any information re cause of delay and for how long we would need to wait and only announced the delay after being urged by me and only in Russian (I had to translate it into Italian for non-Russian speakers.",Aeroflot Russian Airlines,A321,,

The security guards spoke none, except for the one who could yell ""go."" The worst part is that they all made us share a room with a complete stranger even though several passengers tried to refuse. We also weren't allowed to have our checked luggage, so we had to sleep in a room with a stranger with next to nothing. We were then escorted to our flight the next morning though none of them spoke English and were incredibly rude and short. At passport control, I was screamed at in Russian for not showing my hotel voucher, of which no one ever told us to keep or show to anyone after the hotel.

We were also offered small screen devices and headphones for watching films, but I didn't take one. There were only two seats per row, which meant they were really wide. The downside was that we hadn't been able to select seats in advance, and I noted that the first row of seats was empty and would've preferred to have been seated in a row on my own, where I could get up freely, rather than next to a stranger, whom I had to disturb if I wanted to get up. I wasn't even able to select window seat or aisle seat, which I think is unsatisfactory. Other than this, you felt like it was a proper business class flight - we even got toiletry bags, blankets, and a gift of speciality tea to take with us on landing. Apart from not being able to select seats, it was far superior to the KLM business flight that I took on the return flight. Having said that, the staff - though efficient - were rather 'cold' in their manner (never smiled and never exchanged pleasantries), which is a sharp contrast to the KLM staff on the return flight. (But this might reflect Eastern European professional culture - I experienced similar cold, but efficient, professionalism once in a 5 star hotel in Tallin.)

The flight was scheduled to leave at 11:50 AM. No explanation, no apology, no nothing. Fortunately the agency that had made the original reservation has a 24/7 help line, and the agent I spoke to there was able to discover that the plane I was booked to fly on had no seating configuration for Premium Economy. The only seating choices were Economy or Business - this from the airline that had accepted a reservation and payment for a Premium Economy seat 4 months before. I have no problem with airlines having to change equipment, but I think it's fair to expect them to notify affected passengers about changes in the seating configuration. If I hadn't called, Aeroflot would have sprung this on me at the airport, when my only choices would have been to accept the downgrade to Economy or upgrade to Business for an additional $3K+. Instead I cancelled the reservation and rebooked Economy on Finnair, where at JFK I was able to purchase a Premium Economy upgrade on one segment for 60 Euros, and where I got a free upgrade to Business Class on another. I booked Aeroflot originally because I had heard that they had substantially improved their inflight services, and perhaps that it still true. Since I never got on the flight, I wouldn't know.

The return flight on A330-300 was better than we expected - 3 or 4 yrs old aircraft with a decent amount of leg space (in comparison with Alitalia it was better), pretty good IFE and really nice food - sushi and seafood pasta which I can say was probably the best onboard meals I've ever had. SVO-FCO in A320 was also nice, good Recaro blue seats and again pretty good meals. Service wasn't smiling a lot, but was attentive and my and my group really enjoyed the flights. All in all Aeroflot exceeded expectations! would definitely recommend it (except for the airport staff in Rome which wasn't helpful at all with rebooking the ticket!).",Aeroflot Russian Airlines,A330-300,4,

Seats on the Boeing 737-800 are only to be used for short distances, less than 4 hours. Mine was a medium haul flight of 6 hours. A night flight with chairs not to be used for sleeping. No real business class flat bed seat on these planes. A great pity.

Brand new in-flight entertainment system on the B777-300ER, same day / night destination time zone synchronization lighting (i.e. blue during the day time at destination) as is found on the new Boeing 787.

The flight from LED to SVO had a delay and although we were told that the connecting flight would wait for us as (because of the re-booking) there would be a large group of SXF passengers on board, it did not. But directly upon entering SVO airport a SU representative would hand out pre-printed new boarding passes and a beverage voucher, so no need to go to a transfer desk. I found that quite professional. The aircraft used were in very good shape and we found seats and legroom far superior to most western airlines. Crews were dressed in very attractive uniforms and were quite fluent in English. Alcoholic drinks and a sandwich (even a pre-ordered vegetarian one for my companion) were offered - basic, but hey, that's the way it is nowadays. Small downpoint: the very interestingly looking in-flight magazine was almost exclusively in Russian language. The transfer in SVO (as well as entering Russia in LED) was quick and smooth (performed by traditionally grumpy staff, though). The sparkling airports in LED and SVO but Berlin's SXF trashy airport to shame.

I don't know if this is a problem to do with the airline or airport. Once on board we were greeted by a clean and new looking airbus. The economy seats were cramped on our trans-atlantic stretch but not more so than other US and European carriers I've flown. The service was fairly good. The cabin crew were all business and no smiles, but they came around often to see if passengers needed anything. We had two hot meals that were edible and the in seat entertainment system had a really good selection of films. My only complaint on the trans-atlantic flight was that breakfast was served three hours before landing at 4.30 am Moscow time, unnecessarily cutting into sleep time. Our short-haul leg was equally comfortable. Again the planes looked new and were very clean. Cabin staff came through with snacks and beverages. Overall I found Aeroflot a pleasant experience. I think the airlines greatest weakness is its Moscow hub. The trans-atlantic schedules require long layovers.

During the 9 hour flight we only got a cold drink once(!) even during dinner we didn't get anything to drink other than coffee or tea afterwards. This was a day flight and I didn't sleep so I didn't miss anything I'm sure. 1.5 hour delay which is perfectly acceptable for me but don't let us board and tell us every 5 minutes that the delay will be an extra 5 minutes (and in 3 languages again). The sign ""fasten seatbelts"" was lit for 3/4 of the flight but I didn't feel any turbulence at all seemed like the stewards didn't want people to stretch their legs.

The Inflight-entertainment system itself was not bad. I would say slightly below average but still okay. The problem were the headphones. The headphones were so bad that you could not understand a word. So we could not watch a single movie during our 10 hour flight. At least no movie with sound. Food was standard. Neither good nor bad. I would not complain if the price would have been low.

No problem with transfer. Good in-flight entertainment on B773. Food in economy just OK. We got an upgrade to Comfort class on BKK-SVO which was great. Big seats and plenty of leg room. Food also better - but not sure if better because of Comfort class or because made in Thailand. I don't like Aeroflots bread buns wrapped in plastic. They ought to have fresh bread. I also think all passengers on all long haul flights ought to be given 05 litres of water in bottles. Only difference to other European 3 and 4 star carriers appears to be the no alcohol policy.

We were provided with slippers blankets pillows and eye shields. The staff were very courteous and announcements were made in Russian and English. The entertainment had a terrific selection of movies and music. If you are a tall person you are better off purchasing the emergency exit seats as they were so much more comfortable for someone 6'. Connection in Moscow which I was a bit fearful of was actually a very nice experience. They accepted US dollars. Most sales people spoke some English. Free wifi in coffee shops. The cleanest airport I have ever been to with janitors cleaning the toilets constantly wiping down all chrome pillars in hallways. Sparkling clean. Connections were smooth where my check in luggage went straight to my destination without having to recheck. The smaller airbus for my 4 hour flight to Venice did not have any entertainment video but did serve a meal. I recommend Aeroflot as great airline for the price!

We know we'll miss our connection to Bangkok so instead of arriving in Bangkok at 8.30 we were late 2.5 hours!

Why do they make everyone disembark with all their hand luggage check the luggage through security when it hasn't been anywhere but on the aircraft since the previous security check and then make everyone get right back on the very same plane? If you are seated at the back of the aircraft then you spend your whole lay- over at Moscow airport standing in a queue to get through security. The food was almost inedible and my Chinese travelling companions played cards on the backs of the airline seats throughout most of the flight and all stood up to get their bags out of the overhead lockers when the pilot announced that we would be landing in three minutes!

I have travelled with Aeroflot several times within the past year I have to say that the level of service you get with this airline is inconsistent. Compared to my last trip with them (STR-SVO-LED and back) which was extremely satisfying this time the service is only so-so. For SVO-PEK the cabin crew seemed inexperienced. The crew disappeared immediately after dinner service. The food from SVO is very average and the cleanliness of the toilet was not maintained well during the flight. For the return trip the crew members seemed much more experienced and they delivered a fairly high level of service. The food was also significantly better. Overall I think Aeroflot is improving. However they still have a long way to go. As a passenger your experience with them can vary greatly depending on the crew or the route.

When on board we found that they were not only normal economy seats but in fact were exactly the same ones that we had reserved previously (before her leg break). So not only was service unacceptable but also the staff seem to have > deliberately deceived us at the customer service and check in desks. I assume to move us on without having to do anything else. So they let the company down and of course passed the problem on to the flight attendants who also did nothing much to help. Very poor indeed.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,3,

It was a very positive experience. Aeroflot has gone through a large modernization programme in the recent years and it was very evident when I travelled with them. Most of their fleet now consists of modern airliners such as the A320 the A330 and the Boeing 777. I flew on their A320 from CPH to SVO. For a short-haul flight the onboard service was extremely good compared to most European airlines. The food consisted of fresh bread cheese beef and a delicious cake and the cabin crew were serving cold and hot drinks throughout the whole flight. The crew was extremely friendly. Since the plane was only half full many of the passengers were lying down across the seats. The cabin crew immediately offered them blankets and pillows to make them more comfortable. This is the first time I have experienced this on a European flight. The transfer at SVO was smooth and easy. The airport has been renovated and now offers an easy access between the terminals without having to go outside the airport. The passport and security check took less than 10 minutes much to my surprise and I was now standing in Terminal D which had a wide selection of restaurants shops as well as free WiFi. The flight to Tokyo was on an A330. The interior felt fresh and new and the seats were very comfortable although for a tall guy such as myself the legroom left much to be desired but that is not the fault of the airline. The cabin crew on this flight were fluent in English and Japanese. Again very friendly people. There was a passenger in front of me who seemed rather anxious about flying and kept calling the crew throughout the whole flight. They never ignored his calls or talked bad to him. They kept smiling and did what they could to make him feel comfortable. The food was again very tasty and the menu offered both Russian and Japanese dishes and despite the rather cramped space I had a very comfortable flight to Tokyo. I have read many negative reviews about Aeroflot and I will not deny that people might have had some bad experiences but my opinion on Aeroflot is that it is a modern airline that offers some of the cheapest tickets in the world while maintaining a high standard in customer service. I have already booked my next flight with Aeroflot and I will continue to fly with them whenever possible.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,5,

Food was really good compared with other airlines and I was quite satisfied with Aeroflot's service. On the last flight from SVO-HKG that I took today all economy passengers received medium-haul amenity kits from Business class which was surprising as there was only a pair of slippers and eye-shades on the first leg.

Flight was comfortable and only a few minutes late arriving in Moscow. No IFE but it was only a little more than a hour long flight.

I have really nothing positive to say except the low price. Of course we understood that we would not get much because of that low price. However we did not see the crew at all during all the flights only when the food was ready which was at really strange times we and many others on the plane were very hungry. We were served lunch and dinner on the first flight then breakfast on the second. The food was horrible. The food we got for lunch and breakfast was exactly the same and we did not had anything to choose from. The tv-screens at all seats were not working but that was not a big deal for us. We will never fly with Aeroflot again.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,3,

Sat in the first row right were the bathrooms are and was very impressed how ALL flight attendants were constantly checking and cleaning the bathrooms (our American airlines should really take notice of that. Their bathrooms are not clean - to say the least). Also the flight stats are throughout the whole flight very nicely displayed - including nearest towns at what direction and distance - never saw that with our airlines. It also shows ""pilot view"" of take-off and landing - loved that. Actually could recognize all people on the ground shortly before touch down watching the descending airplane at LAX with flashes going off like crazy.

No inflight entertainment - I had my own and the both flights on time. Luggage was amongst the first off in St Petersburg (a big plus given a transit in Moscow).

My experience was horrible. I nicely asked for good seats because I was with 2 children. The worker answered that she could not help me because the computer chooses the seats. Given seats 35K 35G and 35H. At first look it seems normal but when we got to the plane it was shocking. One seat was window side the other two in the middle row. Where is the logic? Where is the common sense and customer care? This was a 12 hour flight.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,3,

For the money is not expensive. The plane for this flight was a brand new A320 with sharklets. Unfortunately without a TV. The dinner was nice. Cabin crew with beauty red uniform were always respectful cheerful and ready to help. Pilots masters of their craft. Like for duty-free sales on board. All in all a great experience.

Flights were on time baggage arrived perfectly the colors and atmosphere on the plane was bright and cheery. I flew economy so like any other airlines you get what you pay for as far as cabin space however in all other respects Aeroflot was superior. Cabin crew were professional and polite food was quite good. Entertainment was superb with 100's of great movies and shows to choose from as well as games wifi charging stations and all the works! I travelled with my children 4 and 7 and had no trouble keeping them busy for 12 hours. Children's meals can be pre-ordered and were well thought out although my picky ones didn't eat them. Kids got tons of goodies from the staff. The value was great and I will fly with them again in the future. My only complaint were the tiny and rather dirty bathrooms. Otherwise excellent airline!,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,5,

Meals as other alternatives but no alcohol served. Seats and leg room are OK. They offer Space + seats located in the emergency exists and prices are reasonable. Cabin crew no friendly enough from my point of view if I compare with other airlines to flight to China like BA Finnair or AF. The main difference is that they provide slippers and eye masks no offered by other airlines. Cabin and toilets are clean enough. Moscow airport is awful and really boring. Distances between terminals and gates are too much long. Flights arrived on time. Entertainment system only in English and Russian. Music selection is OK.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,3,
2258,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,1,3,,4,6,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,A Bor (Latvia) 6th July 2014,unk,RIX-SVO-PVG and back. From RIX to SVO it was a partner flight with Air Baltic. Then came the horror of SVO-PVG. I had no option to choose seats. I was asked in RIX while checking in for seat preference and I said aisle. I did get one for RIX-SVO and for SVO-PVG I got a 28th row which on their A330 is in front of the toilets and the seat does not recline. The seats were rather worn and entertainment system was slow though the selection of media was excellent. The food was plain insulting with 2cm of salmon sliced over some canned carrots and peas presented as a salad. The bun was hard and the choice of main course was chicken or fish for dinner and chicken or goulash for the supper. The dessert was surprisingly good though I had to wait 40 minutes for the tea to have it with while they were finishing servicing everyone. And now for the best part the service. Apparently they are split in the teams of 2 with some kind of good cop / bad cop principle as in both aisles we've seen one was making attempts to smile and the other one was plain offensive. The bathrooms were hardly cleaned the pilots announcements were hardly audible. So imagine my surprise when on the return flight from Shanghai to Moscow I was greeted by a very professional and helpful staff (still not smiling) got into a very comfortable seat of a brand new shiny 777 with plenty of room even with 3-4-3 scheme great new entertainment system with touchscreen much fresher air and the food was really delicious including a very fresh bun. The short flight SVO-RIX was also very pleasant with a nice little airbus with sufficient space a delicious chicken sandwich and soft drinks and the sweetest flight attendant. To sum it all I'd say its a real hit and miss thing with Aeroflot. Stay away from the airbus on the long flights make sure its a 777 they're great. If you're unlucky enough to get airbus steer clear of row 28. The food probably depends on where they get it. The entertainment is excellent on long flights tons of good movies TV shows and music. Do not expect a good polite service on every flight. Other than that flights were on time with great connections and very reasonably priced.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,5,
2259,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,2,3,,3,6,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,A van der Made (Netherlands) 6th July 2014,unk,Flight from Amsterdam to Tokyo Narita via SVO and back. First flight from AMS to SVO on codeshare flight with KLM on B738. Flight was OK. Transit on SVO from terminal E to D was a breeze. There were no lines at immigration or security check. As we had a stopover for 6 hours we used the capsule hotel which was accessible from terminal D and E on airside (63 Euros for 4 hours). Flight from SVO to NRT was on an A333. Nice and new aircraft with good seats and complete IFE. We had 4 seats in a row for the two of us as the aircraft was about half full. Crew was attentive and quitte friendy. With one hour delay we arrived at NRT. The flight from NRT back to SVO gave us however some mixed emotions. on an A333 but with a crew that wasn't as friendly as the flight to NRT. We got the feeling we were bothering them even with some basic requests for drinks. Toilets were very dirty on this flight not only the fault of the crew as well as fellow passengers. Transit from terminal D to E on SVO was a mess. At immigration and security check there were long lines with a lot of people cutting lines. Flight from SVO to AMS on an A320 was better than the flight from NRT. Aircraft was however in a bit of a run down state and also quite dirty. Toilet was also in a poor state. The crew however was extremely friendly and flight arrived on time. In the end Aeroflot gave us mixed feelings. If you don't have many expectations for the price you pay for the flight the airline is OK. At SVO you need either luck or a lot of patience concerning transits of flights. If we would fly again with this airline really depends on the price of the flights they offer.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,4,

From HK to Moscow Moscow to UK UK to Moscow Moscow home. The first leg was ""bearable"" if a little short on snacks and food options - so much so that the first thing I did was to buy a little bag of peanuts to go in my carry on. The second leg was uncomfortable due to the shell seats which are nothing sort of a torture device. Two weeks pass before the third leg which was same seats same limited choice of movies and even the same food. The fourth leg - the entertainment system took around an hour to load. Same movies even though it was a different month! But the real issue for me was the meal. With almost every meal they serve 2 pieces of bread. The white ""loaf"" is always icy cold and hard. The little brown slice was also cold and hard. There was not enough butter for both. Given the price I paid for my ticket I didn't expect gourmet food but the piece of salmon was literately the size of a teaspoon. The chicken was barely warm. Usually the food is served piping hot and even if the bread is not heated if you leave your roll on top of your main meal you can get a bit of heat and steam into it. No such luck. The dessert - there was nothing to eat it with in the utensil pack was exactly what it looked like tasteless overly sweet faux cream. Breakfast I chose the pancakes which I was unable to eat they were far too sweet. I was pretty hungry by the time we landed.",Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,2,

The planes were very clean and the cabin crews were very friendly and professional. 1) On LED-SVO I put the sandwich in my bag as I was not hungry at that time. The flight attendant who was serving tea/coffee saw I did not have a sandwich on my tray table so she asked me very kindly in English whether I was hungry and why not take a sandwich for snack. 2) On SVO-STR after I walked into the back cabin the flight attendant greeted me and offered to guide me to my seat. 3) The SVO-STR flight (3hrs) included a full lunch with a very generous portion of cold cut salmon and potato salad as the starter and lamb and buckwheat as the main course. The dessert was a granola bar with honey chocolate cherry and apple coating. It was very tasty! Overall from my 4 flights with Aeroflot within two weeks I have to say the level of service is quite good and consistent. I think it is really time to change the stereotype that many of us had for the Russian national carrier for many years!,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,

Stuttgart/STR to St. Petersburg/LED via Moscow-Sheremetyevo/SVO. Both on-time. From STR to SVO the plane was an A320 and from SVO to LED the plane was A321. The seats were very comfortable and the leg room was impressive! I am 178cm/5'10 and after sat down there was about 15cm/6in in front of my knees. In fact you can put one leg on the other without any problems. I often fly Lufthansa from Germany to Russia and in Lufthansa's A320/321 economy cabin you definitely do not see this much leg space. The food was fine. STR-SVO includes a full lunch and two rounds of drink service and SVO-LED includes a teriyaki chicken sandwich and drinks. The staffs were professional and spoke adequate amount of English. The captains of the flights each made 3 announcements in English (welcome in-flight update and a final goodbye after landing) which were quite impressive. Overall I found the trip very pleasant and Aeroflot's has exceeded my expectations! I can see clearly Aeroflot wants to improve and they are making a good effort!,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,

Aeroflot has really stepped up their game. Both flights perfectly on-time. New aircraft fresh IFE (movies TV shows games - lots to choose from) friendly staff. Legroom could be an inch better but it seems that the rows to the back of the aircraft are worse. Food was unimaginative but edible.

Second leg was on an A320. Leg room was even better. Food was better than the first legs and staff once again were professional but English was limited. No IFE on either sector.

As is typical of the former USSR the boarding announcement was met by a scrum of people rushing the boarding gate. No attempt made by the crew to regulate boarding and as a result it took nearly an hour. Once onboard the flight attendants were generally sour and the food was stale and lukewarm. In-flight entertainment was surprisingly good but still a step down from Delta and similar airlines. Despite TLV-SVO being an overnight flight the cabin lights were never dimmed and the service was staggered in a way that essentially prevented all sleeping. Could not figure this out. SVO was pleasant enough and SVO-RIX was an easy short-hop on a new 737. No service and no complaints. Would take Aeroflot again only if the price was significantly less than other European carriers.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,4,

Flight attendants did not smile a lot but were professional. IFE very good with dozens of latest films and music. One thing that could be improved and that's the headphones : they do not give ear cushions and so wearing headphones is very uncomfortable even painful to ears sometimes. The sound quality is also terrible. Quite a pleasant experience on both flights and I will use Aeroflot again. For 250 which is an almost EasyJet price you get a full service package IFE and SkyPriority for a 3 hour flight.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,5,

Two-hour delay of the flight from Moscow due to military parade and air space closure - no fault of the airline. But the boarding process could and should have been organized in a better way. Wonder why the jetbridge hasn't been used. No such problems on the return flight. Both flights on A320 pretty comfortable seats decent space. Training of the staff should clearly be improved first and foremost the language skills and attitude towards passengers. At the same time a young flight assistant on the return flight at least tried to be friendly and attentive. The food was inedible on the first flight and acceptable on the way back. Entertainment should be enhanced ie. by installation of individual multimedia sets in short and medium-haul aircrafts. All in all the general experience is pretty average. The ticket price was actually quite low compared to other offers for these dates considering the flexibility in the choice of flights and the level of seat comfort is pretty good but the main thing is that Aeroflot should be training the staff harder if they want to improve their international profile. Also basing on my experience of traveling with this airline I can say that the quality of in-flight service can differ dramatically on different flights so it is sometimes really a matter of luck.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,2,

Boarding started about 50 people went to the jetty when they stopped everything due to broken galley on board. We were strangled inside the jetway for over 30 mins with no info at all. Couldn't get on board and they closed gate doors so we couldn't comeback to the gate. Horrible service. Flight itself was ok nice 777 but 10 seats abreast is too much on such a long flight - too cramped and not comfortable. Crew were very young tried to smile few times and be nice. IFE was good. Food acceptable but very small portions. No alcohol was served at all. Return flight without any boarding problems. Food much better than from Moscow but no choices were given at all. Young crew didn't smile even once quite poor English female FAs looked very nice and groomed but male FAs looked like some cheap bar workers - all ties untied buttons of shirts were left opened really bad view. Not impressed at all. Generally I wouldn't recommend Aeroflot for longhaul flights as service is quite poor crew inattentive and very cramped cabin but they offer the quickest connection from Western Europe and day flights which saves a lot of time.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,5,

Having to connect at SVO was the only downside to an otherwise comfortable and pleasant trip. Anyone who knows SVO terminal knows that it is overburdened chaotic and in dire need of an overhaul. We made our connecting flight (no thanks to the indifferent Aeroflot ground personnel) only because the aircraft was late arriving in Moscow. That said we still had to run through the terminal. Flights on SU were surprisingly good with comfortable seating choice of well catered meals and cabin attendants who were very professional and friendly. This airline has really upped their game on long haul international flights. In fact I dare say there are equal to if not better than many of their European competitors. And price wise they are way ahead of the game. It's a shame they use SVO as their hub however.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,3,

Seats and Inflight Entertainment were not among the best but still met the average standards you would expect for long-haul flights. The real drawback for Aeroflot is the transfer at SVO in addition to all those comments already made we encountered extra problems as we only had about an hour transfer time on our return journey. A staff member called all passengers to HKG at passport control we were guided through Terminal D and E to the boarding gate at F - all by running there were no trolleys so we had to take all carry on luggage by hand - that's 20 minutes running. Our checked in baggage was left behind only arrived the next day according to Aeroflot's ground agent at HKG this is a daily recurring problem to this flight.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,3,

Economy Feb 15/23 2014 the only one-stop option on this route. AMS-SVO on Feb 15 was OK A321 clean and relatively new. The biggest problem here was the handling agent in Schiphol apparently Aeroflot took the cheapest option out of available and all the issues such as slow poorly trained staff and poor co- ordination with airport services - everything is delayed all the time and every time (I took over 10 Aeroflot flights from AMS during the last two years). No entertainment system. SVO-KJA on the same day was served by a brand new B777. A decent entertainment system but not much space in the economy cabin. KJA-SVO-AMS was served by A319 and 320 - everything described for the A321 on the AMS-SVO route applies here as well. Business-class check- in in KJA was a very strange procedure but in does not have to do with Aeroflot I guess (although my experience with their KJA agents was thoroughly unpleasant so probably they just do not care to check how those procedure work). Safety training of the crew seems to be a very big issue. They just could not care less. Their usual passengers are not very disciplined in general but the crew just does not act on this at all. Food was good on all the legs although the beverages were a bit below average though - juice and wines were really bad (alcohol only on international legs). Transfer in SVO from Terminal F international to terminal D domestic (and especially back) is still a big problem. Poor information little help from staff. When you are transferring from D to F you really shall look around carefully at each turn (there lots of them) - once you skip a little half-hidden pointer - you are running into a wrong spot and getting through security control (double!) all over again. No SkyPriority service in the Terminal F except business class check-in counters and a VERY poor tiny and shabby business lounge.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,3,

At the airport we got upgraded to premium economy for free. Good food good service and some of the air stewardesses even smiled. Others were not so happy but they where attentive.

The price of ticket was 200$-300$ cheaper than the price of a ticket with other airlines. All flights were ok. If not on time either late by a couple of minutes or early by a couple of minutes. IFE great. Staff OK. One of the things I didn't like is the food. It is edible but it is always beef or chicken with a salad or cheese with ham (on all flights) the meals are not diversified. I didn't like the seats. I'm 190cm so it was really uncomfortable for me to sit in this seat for a flight of 9-10hrs but it shouldn't be the same problem for someone shorter. Airport is good. Staff is friendly. Terminal D and E are new and spacious but terminal F is over crowded and there is a lot of stores and not a lot of places to sit. Overall the experience was good. Will take them again and recommend them to someone if price is good.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,5,

Smooth priority boarding at SVO excellent champagne and starters though the main course looked a bit cheap. Attentive staff. I noticed that the flight attendants on both flights tended to smile more and respond more quickly to those who smiled in return. The seats are not lie-flat unfortunately but still softer and more comfortable than the recliners installed by LH on their A380s. The screen is large enough with good colors but the content lacks recent action movies.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,4,

This was some older version airplane I was seated in row 16 in a broken seat and virtually with virtually no legroom. Comfort absolutely inadequate for a 13 hrs flight. After takeoff we were told that we had to land in Oslo to refuel. This turned out to be a 2.5 hrs stopover since no one was informed about our landing and need for fuel. In fact Aeroflot used the opportunity to change the crew so it is very possible that this was the actual cause for the unplanned stopover. All together we spent 16 hrs in that plane and of course missed the connecting flight on DL airlines.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,4,

They changed the gate at the last minute and didn't make an announcement. We unfortunately missed our flight because of this and they weren't sympathetic at all. Mind you we had a toddler with us and I was 7 months pregnant. It was awful. We had to pay for a new flight and didn't give us many options.

Not very punctual - departed and arrived 20 minutes late. Terminal F at SVO is crowded and inconvenient. Cabin crew friendly and efficient. Food was served twice good choice tasty meals. Entertainment system is very good. Blankets and earphones were given to all the passengers. Seat comfort was very poor to me. Seats are narrow with surprisingly little legroom. When you recline your seat the bottom part goes forward it makes the legroom smaller. Not the best experience ever but I would fly them again if the price is fair.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,5,

Flight from Tokyo was pretty good. From Moscow there are no direct gates so you have to take a bus to board the plane. Waited 10 minutes inside the bus while it was right under the plane already. Another one and a half hour inside the plane before they drive us back to the airport and gave us 400RUB (gets you a coffee). Overall the flight was late by almost 6 hours on a 4 hours route. From Tel Aviv the flight was late by about half an hour. Upon landing had to board the bus again. It drove for about 20 minutes to the terminal. My bags didn't arrive to Tokyo (because the connection was too short). Will never fly with them again - it was cheaper by less than 100USD but definitely not worth it.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,4,

On business service rivals some airline first classes even on Russian domestic short sectors printed menus and wine list lots of reading material (counted 5 different Aeroflot publications on a 1:45 min flight) and crews very attentive and caring.

We were told that Aeroflot would send another plane the next morning to pick up all passengers. But as usual it was too expensive for Aeroflot. Instead of another plane they started to check-in passengers on ""free"" seats for other Aeroflot flights. It was 7 hours of chaos. No one from Aeroflot was there no order no food no water.

The airplanes are good however the transit service is really poor this might be because of the airport it is hard to figure out your flight gate and it is complicated to get information from the staff. Waiting hours are awful I expected to get some sort of cabin or something upon arrival but sleeping on the floor buying your own drinks is about it.

2296,,Economy Class,,,no,3,4,5,,4,5,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,Kyle Brown (United States) 9th October 2013,unk,Roundtrip from Dulles International Airport to the Czech Republic stopping in Moscow. Dissatisfaction is the word that came to mind repeatedly during these series of flights. The food was excellent. Served on time and hot on each of these flights. Very consistent. The cost was excellent compared to other airlines offering the same trip. It was downhill from there. Of the total 4 flights required to make this trip zero were on time. Every single flight left late. This is clearly a normal practice for this Airline based on my experience. The initial flight to Moscow from Dulles (10 hours or so) had no working video displays for entertainment. There was working music but the headphone connector on the seat was shorted and would barley play sound in mono and only if held in a certain position. After landing and proceeding to the terminal in Moscow there was complete chaos. The airport appeared to be clean and new with lots of English signage however some of the people working in the terminal seemed to be avoiding anything that resembled being helpful. Most seemed to have attitudes for some reason. Russian passengers herded like cattle to the tiniest security checkpoint area that I have ever seen. There were 4 lanes for 300 people. The return flight was worse. After I reached Moscow from the Czech Republic there was more herding to the security checkpoint. This time a customs representative sat at a desk near by reading a book as a few hundred people waited in lines that barley moved. I asked the person reading the book if I was standing in a special line or something since the signs were not in English she responded that I should find another line in a tone that indicated the I was disturbing her. I eventually wasted an hour before I discovered that I was in the area of customs for domestic flights and not international. The International flight area took 3 minutes to process. This theme of herding and poor manners played out at every airport except for the final destination back in the US. I will never fly Aeroflot again. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,1,
2297,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,3,,4,7,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,L Ruggeri (Hong Kong) 7th October 2013,unk,Moscow-Hong Kong flight was well below my expectations. Terminal F has been revamped with too many shops and not enough seats. Passengers camped on the stairs and the floor. As there were other flights to China departing from nearby gates almost at the same time one can only imagine the pushing shouting and queue-jumping. Allocating more space to people and less to shops would help address the problem. We boarded on time but some passengers had so many duty-free shopping bags that overhead storage soon reached maximum capacity. Tempers flared departure was delayed. I had to keep my backpack under the seat thus reducing that precious little space. After takeoff we were told that the entertainment system was out of order. No films no music no games. nothing. I had ordered a vegetarian meal at the time of buying the ticket online 6 months earlier and this is usually a very tasty Asian- style hot meal. This time my name didn't appear on the flight attendants' list despite being clearly indicated in the electronic ticket in my possession. Flight attendants ignored the issue and just apologized for the mistake. The best they could offer was a normal tray with two small salads instead of one. A few hours later when they served breakfast I realised that 2 out of 3 standard options were ok for vegetarians. Why wasn't a breakfast tray offered to me at dinner time? Flight attendants started serving tea and coffee. Due to turbulence they had to stop serving hot drinks and at least 100 passengers were left without any hot beverages to accompany their breakfast. The turbulence ended but serving hot beverages was never resumed. All in all not the best experience.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,3,

However on the way back home from St. Petersburg is where all the problems started. Our original flight was delayed 12 hours which meant missing all our connections. We stood in line for 5 hours. The service at the airport was horrible. No one would help us get a flight. After many hours different lines talking to many representatives we made a call to our Travel Agent and the Emergency help number that we had.

Seems like the seats were designed by Gestapo for torturing passengers for 10 hours. Short narrow leaned forward! I will never understand the purpose of the head piece which makes your head protrude forward even more unless you are more than 2 meters tall. I felt very uncomfortable and tired. It was especially bothersome due to slow food service (it took the flight attendants about 2 hours to serve lunch and tidy up).,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,5,

Food was great I asked for an extra meal on both flights and they gave it to me. The offered wine for free in economy class. FA also friendly. The only concern is the delays. When I flew there the delay was 40 min on the way back the washroom broke down in the aircraft so the delay was 4 hours.

Bus stopped about a hundred metres from the steps to the aircraft as the heavens opened. 50 people ran at once to try to escape the deluge. Utter chaos and appalling management by Aeroflot. Cabin crew were singularly unhelpful saying to a passenger who complained ""it's not our decision"". It took a good half hour from when the door was closed to take off which added to the frustration of the delay. But once airborne things took a turn for the better. The Cain crew were personable and efficient. Dinner was served promptly and was tasty. Impressive too was the nutritional information next to each dish - calories protein carbohydrates. The Italian red wine was more drinkable than many I've had elsewhere. IFE was via individual players that were handed out after a polite request. Reasonable selection of films. Spent a further frustrating 30 minutes in the hold before landing 90 minutes late. Luggage took another 20 or so - definitely not treated as priority.

Our plane was delayed but we arrived only 7 minutes later than it was proposed). Cabin was originally designed for EgyptAir and it was very good.

No IFE but who cares. 16 seats left in economy I volunteered to give up seat 7C to the back row next to toilets as it allowed for stretching. Service devoted. Alcohol charged as only free on intercontinental flights. I would assume that SVO-DXB is pretty much intercontinental? Service excellent though by sitting on last row one is left with no food options but the ones left (clalf-meat) was good. English poor-very poor. Staff charming young and in excellent mood. DXB-NBO operated by Kenya Airways. Overbooked on business class 1 person was downgraded. I got one of the very last seats in the middle of an 2-3-2 configuration. But the staff were good hard-working in a sparkling mood and attentive. Ordered 2 drinks and was given 2 of each (as to make up for busy FAs and few rounds of service). This happened to everybody who cared but only at the first service - IFE on large plenum screen worked surprisingly well. Good information from captain and purser.

Main dish was rice/catfish (white fish meat). Fantastic films on IFE! Small screens but easy to operate and good selection of films including some Russian movies of high quality. Staff nice and caring especially when speaking loud slow clear and polite English to them as their English is at times limited. Stewardesses were appealing dressed in neat smart orange-coloured summer uniforms! SVO-CPH in smaller Sukhoi jet which is nice similar to Airbus 319.

Had to sprint from terminal F to D but made good time and domestic counter service again efficient and friendly. All planes on time.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,4,

Flight was delayed from DC. No reason given or even boarding announcement. Strange things: inflight safety video on old 767 was set to techno music first in-flight movie on overhead screens was a 1940s black-and-white Soviet film with English subtitles and they serve drinks about 20 minutes before meals so you're thirsty again by the time you eat.

Arrival at SVO new Terminal D quick and easy transit at both passport/security. SVO-PVG departed from Terminal F very long walkway from D to F. Terminal F awful old/dark/busy. Lounge at Terminal F was difficult to find. I was refused entry because I did not have the invitation card. Had to go to transit desk. After entering I noted the lounge was full no seat available. Flight to Shanghai on time with new and clean A330. Seats 2-2-2 not full flat but comfortable to sleep. Good onboard service greeting by purser/crews with good English skill. Foods (3 choices) very tasty. AVOD with 500 programs. Return: quick check-in with 2 boarding passes good spacious lounge. Flight PVG-SVO at 1.30 am. Old/tired B767 seat 2-2-2 narrow and less comfortable than A330 portable IFE with DVD-player same good onboard service. Landed at Terminal F and lesson learned went to transit desk asking for C-Lounge Access card. SVO-HAM A320 left Terminal D on time with best European C Class cabin I have flown.

Seats are proper business class seats (2-2 config) but they do look and feel a bit outdated already. Nevertheless still comfortable and there's plenty of space. Cabin crew were polite and effective. The main (and only) complaint on this flight was the quality of food. The main dish was pretty much inedible but the choice of wines and drinks was good. Transfer in Moscow was quick and easy. No delays at security screening/passport control. Terminal F is bad in comparison to terminals D and E. The Classic or the ""First class"" lounge is old crowded and all in all unpleasant. Boarding the BKK flight was chaotic. Even if priority was given to business passengers there was no real control as to who was boarding first. Nevertheless managed to be one of the first ones onboard. Once onboard was shown to my seat and offered the pre-flight drink by a friendly cabin crew member. Aircraft was a brand new 777-300ER with a new cabin design throughout the aircraft. Business class seats (2-2-2 config) found these seats very comfortable and the atmosphere of the cabin modern and pleasant. Cabin crew professional friendly and attentive. A 3 course dinner was served and the quality of the food was much better. Plenty of drinks offered. IFE system with proper wide screens offers sufficient amount of entertainment apart from the choice in music. All in all a very positive experience with Aeroflot.

Both flights were drastically delayed (from Moscow to Vietnam 6 hours and back 12.5 hours). I missed all my connecting flights and lost hotel bookings. Unfortunately Aeroflot didn't give any information about estimated boarding or departure times as well as reasons for the delays. No foods or drinks served in Moscow during 5 hours of waiting!

The LED-SVO leg even had the bonus of the purser giving a brief of what one could see or do in Moscow. The meal services on both legs were conducted at lightning speed which I initially found worrisome as I was only halfway through my ARN-SVO meal when I saw the crew collecting the trays four rows away but I did see that the mainly Russian and Swedish passengers were already done eating so it was probably my pace that was the issue. For the prices I paid Aeroflot delivered exceptional value. I expected a Soviet relic but I experienced efficiency and service at its Russian best.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,

On the way back from MAD to BKK first flight got delayed 2.5 hours so when we arrive in SVO connection to BKK had already departed. Instead of giving us a hotel they gave us a boarding pass to Seoul! We arrived to Seoul without any idea of what to do next nobody say anything to us no information. There they gave us a boarding pass to BKK with Korean airlines for 6 hours later. Arrive into Bangkok with more than 12 hours delay they inform us that our bags were still in Moscow. The worst customer service.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,3,

Separate check-in for business class disturbed by allowing economy class pax using the biz-class check-in counter. However correct check in though a bit stressful as the airport and particularly the flight to Moscow was crowded. Flight HAN-SVO overbooked and roughly 20 of 34 seats in business were economy pax being upgraded to business. FA managed to accommodate all additional pax. Access to lounges in HAN SVO and VIE went smoothly. Invitation cards issues at check in and at transfer desk in SVO. In SVO you are free to choose which of 4-5 Aeroflot lounges you want access to. FA staff polite at a first glance a bit too firm and not truly kind. Seats are good. The lie flat on A330-300 is a bit angled but sleep-able. Food present in good quantities and good though not sophisticated. Drinks are good. Champagne/juice offered 2-3 times at take-off. Disappointment is that after departure and until you get any drink they go and take orders which complicate things and the serving of the first drinks happens only 1.5-2 hours after departure. No drink wagons everything is brought by hand to individuals. Food is good a bit tasteless 3 options. Refills or modifications are made possible. FA-English skills very poor. Entertainment acceptable but earphones are collected an hour prior to landing. Altogether a bit rough and robust service but no major faults apart for very slow 1st service on board. Good value for money if you buy discounted biz- class. 3 of 4 flights on time only the last flight was delayed due to snowstorm in Moscow.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,4,

Staff do not speak English but they were professional. The food was atrocious and the beverages were fine but I would like to see anyone screw up an apple juice.

Both flights delayed (40 minutes and almost 2 hours respectively) which might have been a problem if I had transit. The seats are atrocious and some of them were broken. Mine were broken on both flights (headrest wouldn't stay and the tray table was squeaky and uneven). The service is more or less ok quite a lot of smiles although crew disappeared right after the meal for 8 hours. They answered the calls quickly so not really a problem. The meal was mediocre quality hit or miss catering from Hong Kong significantly better than from Moscow. They ran out of meal options on both flights pretty quickly. IFE screen was malfunctioning on both flights although after they restarted it it worked flawlessly. The system is pretty slow but I liked the movie selection. Aeroflot misinformed us twice on the gate we were arriving to which made it hard to greet us at the right terminal. They also decided that the bus is good enough to deliver the huge crowd of 300+ passengers to the terminal. Overall the experience was poor especially because of the seat pitch problem and broken seats. I must say Aeroflot is quite good on short- haul and medium-haul European flights but I would never take a long-haul with them again - the seats the delays and overall service leaves a lot to be desired and the overall feel is Aeroflot doesn't care about its customers at all.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,4,

Attendants not smiling but are very professional and try to help as much as they can. Plane was an Airbus albeit the plane on the online sales was shown as IL96 Turbo. Plane didn't look very clean.

Eventually boarded and was a nice trip. Arrived Moscow through Passport Control and Security then a long fast walk to Terminal F told to go to gate 46 arrived there no passengers around then told to go to another gate arrived there to find the flight was delayed for technical reasons original boarding was at 20.00hrs but told to come back to the gate at 21.05hrs. At the new time were let through to go onto the Air Bridge instead of an aircraft at the end of the bridge was a metal staircase and buses got on the bus doors wide open minus 20 outside. Eventually doors closed bussed to far end of airport and held in the bus 50metres from the aircraft a wait of 20 minutes and we were let onto the plane after our brisk 50m walk. Passengers boarded then 2.5 hrs after original take off time we eventually got into position. Flight okay food edible. Upon arrival at BKK just after landing and heading towards the Air Bridge passengers rushing to get to the door the plane had not even left the taxiing area.

It is a separated cabin with wall and real C Class seats and seat pitch. After seated the FA offered a glass of champagne or orange juice and handed over the lunch menu (3 choices). After take off the purser came and greeted every passenger personally and handed over the portable IFE Digiplayer. Digiplayer offered limited IFE but more than okay for a 3 hrs flight. Lunch was very tasty. Arrival at Moscow Sheremetyevo newest Terminal D.

AVOD was average - not the greatest selection but enough to please. Transfer at SVO was very easy. Lounge at SVO was average - ok food drinks and good wifi. SVO-TXL on an A320. Immaculate condition of plane and the staff/inflight meals were excellent for a 2.5 hour flights. FAs handed out portable players for flight which is great. Very impressive short-haul service.

We checked in for our return flight in St. Petersburg for Amsterdam. We requested that we and our luggage be booked thru to Detroit. the attendant assured us that it was done. Upon arrival in Amsterdam we were informed by KLM that they did not receive confirmation of our flight from Amsterdam to Detroit and our seats had been resold. 10 hours later we were aboard a Delta flight on the way home. The issue was not in translation because our request had been relayed by our Russian Tour director and our luggage was booked thru to Detroit. Never again.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,3,

Old B767 clean but worn no entertainment nice food the crew unengaged and strangely non-relaxed. Transfer in SVO had slightly improved since the last time but the same one has to get all the luggage travel with it about 1 km and check in again. The navigation system in the terminal is confusing but manageable. Business lounge in the domestic departure terminal D is small heavily smelling with tobacco and a strange selection of food - basically only rolls and cookies. A bit more food is available from the bar for extra pay. SVO-KJA a new A321; the seats were standard economy class with standard pitch which was a bit painful in the overnight flight food good the crew was slightly more attentive to passenger needs. The return flight was the same with the only comment that business lounge in the Terminal F is way worse than in the Terminal D - not clean even stronger tobacco smell and no food at all but Terminal F is terrible in itself so no big surprise. It is a recommendation for this route but only because this is the only option available.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,2,

The SVO terminals which I used ie Terminal D (for long flights) and F (inter European flights) were connected and seemed to be walking through miles of duty free shops with little seats.

The planes from LHR to SVO are generally new and clean. Onward from Moscow the planes are ancient although the business class seats recline flat. The food is always the same - just about edible in business class. Out of my last 4 journeys my luggage has been lost 3 times. Going to give up with Aeroflot and fly Korean air via Seoul now.

2357,,Business Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,4,8,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,Alan Sargeant (Australia) 29th August 2012,unk,Bangkok - Moscow - Simferopol. Flights departed and arrived on time. The crew was professional and reasonable friendly. The level of English was more than adequate. The hand held entertainment systems between Bangkok and Moscow were rather dated and substandard for a business class cabin. There was no entertainment on the shorter Moscow - Simferopol sector. From Bangkok to Moscow the cabin was almost full but service standards were maintained. Food was good. From Moscow to Simferopol the cabin the crew served a good meal on the short flight.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,3,
2358,,Economy Class,,,no,3,2,2,,5,5,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,T Hume (United Kingdom) 16th August 2012,unk,PVG-SVO-AMS. Got the lowest price available by a long way so wasn't expecting too much. The flight from PVG-SVO was at 1.40am - the new planes apparently are on the earlier route so the plane was very spartan with shared TVs which showed one film throughout the whole journey. Staff were so serious that it was quite comical (does it hurt to smile?). SVO-AMS was again on a very basic plane this time with no TVs at all but at least the staff were nicer despite very poor English. Acceptable for a very cheap flight but I wouldn't choose them if there were other airlines at a similar price.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,2,

DEL-SVO was late by more than 6 hours and as per the airline rules we should have got a hotel stay. Instead we had to spend the whole 6.5 hours at the IGI T3. Supposed to board an A330-200 which was unfortunately unavailable so we boarded a A330-300 with wide and comfortable seats and on-board entertainment facility! An hour after take off came the drinks. Then the main- course followed by a delicious cake and a cup of tea or coffee. All flights were smooth and flight staff courteous. In all my experience was very good.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,5,

Flight boarded on time it was a A321 instead of the scheduled A320 due to high volume booking as elite plus we were lucky to be upgraded which was a very pleasant surprise. Welcome drink amenity set and a 2x2 configuration. After take off received a nice hot lunch and a drink but the remaining 2 hours no service quite odd. For business seats for European business good service should be better. DIGI player was good for a 3.5 hr flight.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,4,

Unfortunately A330 was unavailable for this trip (despite being advertised on the website) and instead we boarded a Soviet era IL96's. Flight left at least an hour late many of the seats failed to recline and there was no onboard entertainment system in economy. No apologies were offered for this bait-and-switch move by the airline. A glance at the business class section revealed two rows of slightly oversize seats separated by a curtain across the entire width of the cabin. If I were a business class passenger I would be furious . Other than that the flight was relatively smooth and uneventful. My advice would be to avoid this airline on flights over 3 hours and go with the competition instead.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,1,
2363,,Economy Class,,,yes,5,4,4,,5,9,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,Thomas Mac (United States) 3rd July 2012,unk,I flew May 3rd NYC-MOSCOW connection MOSCOW-KIEV $1500 2 adult tickets. The flight was great! On time and arrived early in Moscow on a nice Airbus A330. The plane was fairly new. The seats bathrooms and interior of the plane was excellent. The food on the transatlantic flight there and back were both great. Chicken or fish with veggies bread and chocolate. The only complaint I would make is they serve the drinks and wait too long to serve the food. They served the drinks 15 mins before the food was served so by the time I got my food I had no drink. The service was 7 of 10. The flight from Moscow to Kiev was excellent as well. 1hr and 15mins on time. Overall Aeroflot is a good airline I would fly with them again!,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,5,
2364,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,5,4,,5,9,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,Elizabeth Kurlykova (United States) 13th June 2012,unk,JFK to Moscow. Check-in went smoothly. From JFK-SVO the seats were as comfortable as could be. Flight attendants were friendly the food very good: served drinks dinner tea/coffee drinks breakfast tea/coffee. I felt comfortable asking for additional drinks. Inflight entertainment had a very good selection. Once I arrived in Moscow my bags needed to be collected and checked in again. When I came back to the airport 9 hours later I was surprised to find that check-in was easy with no long lines. Once onboard I was surprised to find the airplane in such good condition. There was no inflight entertainment on a 5.5 hour flight but the crew were friendly. The food was my only real disappointment. I'll definitely be flying Aeroflot in the future.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,4,
2365,,Business Class,,,yes,4,4,4,,4,7,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,Roman Stepantsev (Russian Federation) 7th June 2012,unk,Usually I'm flying Economy for business purposes and Business class for leisure. When flying Economy Aeroflot is very good for short haul flights to EU. When flying Business quality issues arise. Lounges sometimes are packed both in terminals D and F especially in the morning or late in the evening. Secondly onboard quality service is unsustainable: sometimes attendants are nice and helpful sometimes rude and evasive. Aeroflot always forgets about its Business class passengers and priority Boarding especially in terminal F for long haul flights. However the major problem is the home airport of Sheremetyevo. In most cases people are spending an awful long time just to leave the airport area. Queuing in a traffic jam next to the airport for an hour on Saturday night after a 2 week vacation and Business Class experience crosses everything out about the Aeroflot flight. So my recommendation to use Aeroflot would pretty much depend on the route time and class.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,4,

Experienced a poor service throughout except for the food. At check-in I asked if I could request an aisle seat or one with extra legroom (I'm 6ft 7ins) I was told I had to pay 50 pounds if I wanted it. Of course this made the journey very uncomfortable straight away as on both flights I was sat in between passengers. Both aircraft's were very old especially for the long haul Moscow to Shanghai. Entertainment consisted of a projector and white screen at the front of the cabin - the worst entertainment I've ever endured on a 9 hour flight. Staff seemed slow and unresponsive at times however did serve regular drinks and the food was nice. In future I would rather pay a bit extra with other airlines. Overall a poor service.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,1,

Cabin crew generally never smile and disappear after lunch. Though my personal entertainment system was not working and my seat was broken no one apologized all I got from the stewardess was an unfriendly ""yes its broke"" then she went away. If you're on a budget Aeroflot long haul might be an option but be aware that you'll suffer big time for the 200€ you save.

BRU-SVO on a small airbus no inflight entertainment and the staff's ability to speak English was average with a smile every now and then. I got a small warm meal for the 3.5 hours flight. Transfer at SVO airport was below average. Friendliness was unknown. SVO-PVG on a brand new A330 with decent leg room and various movies and music on individual inflight entertainment system. I got 2 warm meals though only drinks during meals and not in between. PVG-SVO - old Boeing 767 no adaptive head rests small leg room very little seat recline and no individual inflight entertainment. On boarding I went to sleep so missed the menu card. During mealtime I asked what was provided and got an extremely rude answer. No smile tossing objects at me instead of handing over - very disappointed by service.

Amenity bags given out on all legs including European flights. Drinks are good. A330 seats are not full flat but managed to sleep on both legs. A321 seats are real business class seats not economy seat with empty middle seats. AVOD pretty good plenty in English. Business lounge at SVO Terminal F is new but Terminal E is in pretty old - could not find a seat. Lounge food and drink limited. Transit at SVO was not as bas as expected. Issuing business lounge at transit desk can be pain as you need this access card to get into lounge but you can only get the access card through transit desk. No priority boarding on all legs.

If your flight is long haul then I would not recommend this airline. For shorter distances it is fine. General staff service was poor and none could speak other languages apart from Russian.

Together with 10 other people we were guarded to a non visa area in a nearby hotel. We received no communication no new boarding pass and service is lacking. We're not even allowed to leave our hotel room. No sign of Aeroflot within the last 36 hours! The hotel guard explains that lost passengers arrive here every day and that this is very common. The whole service is horrible but the worst part is that really nobody cares! Don't expect any service or any communication.

They put me on an alternate flight on the same route that departed several hours later and included a 12 hour stop in Moscow rather than a 3 hour one. I requested a Vegetarian meal and had this verified prior to the initial cancellation of my flight. No one at Aeroflot bothered to transfer this request to the replacement flight and that flight didn't carry any vegetarian meals. I received some meal tokens to spend in the airport however the value of the tokens was pathetic by any measure. The only eatery open was TGI Fridays and the only vegetarian option there was soup which I ordered with a glass of orange juice. These two meagre items not only came to more than the amount I had in tokens but required me to pay several Euros too!

The only drawback to this flight is the lack of alcohol (and the choice of drinks is indeed rather limited). However that was the only issue I found and it wasn't too much of a problem.

Moscow-Tokyo was not delayed. While food and onboard staff were nice the plane a Boeing 767 was falling apart. Flight entertainment was a Russian dubbed copy of Home Alone in one of the few screens that would pop out here and there.

Moscow-Shanghai on Airbus 330-200 good inflight entertainment best row is 24 with more leg space. The seats on the side are more expensive but the ones in the middle are free of charge.

Nice A321 to Moscow with good meal. Sheveremeteyvo Airport Terminals DE and F now interlinked though website states still bus link. B767's are old and on boarding it was noticeable that the interior had not been refurbished. Once airborne the service and food excellent. The seats were comfortable and the overhead TV had some good films. Return flight from Beijing on new Airbus A330-300 very pleasant and comfortable. Good personal seatback entertainment system with very wide screens for economy class. Lots of choice though some movies not up to date. Food good again. A321 to LHR only half full cabin crew pleasant and attentive food fine and only problem was that cabin lights not dimmed for night flight.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,5,

The outward flight started off good. We left on time and the plane was new and comfortable. The food is of a good standard. However once we landed at Sheremetyevo it was a whole other story. Due to weather we had to wait just yards away from our gate because there was ice on the ground. The plane was very stuffy and I think it took an extra half an hour until we finally stopped at our taxi gate. On the inward flight it was much better. Very quick and comfortable.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,2,

A330 New York-Moscow excellent new and seats were good (2x4x2). Travelling with my wife it was convenient to have the seats to ourselves without someone else next to us. A320 Paris-Moscow just okay nothing extraordinary but not bad (3x3 seating LCD screens in the row). Personal IFE with good selection of movies in Russian and English on JFK-SVO. They served a hot meal with alcoholic beverages plus usual assortment of soft drinks even on flight Moscow to Paris. As someone who'd flown Aeroflot over the past 20 years they have changed for the better over the last couple of years - and are by far the cheapest option to fly from NY to Moscow.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,4,

New A330/A 319 planes clean and good seats. New lie-flat seat on 330 wasn't really flat but perfectly fine for a daytime flight. The real surprise was the 319 which has ""proper"" business class seats even on this short three-hour flight (i.e. four seats in a row rather than the usual six seats with the middle seat kept free). Good selection of food and drinks. Plenty of IFE (about 50 movies to choose from and on-demand even on the short-haul sector). Most staff didn't speak too much English but perfectly fine to get the job done. The only letdown was Moscow airport. Yes the terminal building has been refurbished to international standards but the many uniformed people barking at you in Russian and the organisational chaos are still a nuisance. No customer service culture there. I chose Aeroflot on price and got very good value for money.",Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,3,
2409,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,2,1,,3,4,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,R Langford (United Kingdom) 19th October 2011,unk,I booked a London to Tokyo flight via Moscow as it was the cheapest fare and the journey time was good. We booked vegetarian meals and confirmed these via the booking agent Opodo. However when checking in it became apparent we had no vegetarian meal. The stewards on the first leg were great and rustled up a vegetarian meal for us they were good and I started to wonder what all the bad reviews were about. However during the next leg it was obvious - the staff never smiled and were not helpful with our vegetarian request. The inflight entertainment was not great a few new movies - it was a laugh to see movies from the 70's though. The return leg was not great we didn't even bother asking about the vegetarian meal as I couldn't face the stern expression on the steward. It was not a pleasant journey. Aeroflot is much cheaper than other airline and I would recommend it as it did the trick we arrived safely. So if you are happy to forego smiling staff have a passion for old Russian films and do not want vegetarian food you will love Aeroflot!,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,3,

Moscow-Tokyo leg was great. The seats were comfortable flight attendants friendly and everything went smoothly.

London-Moscow flight was pleasant on a modern plane with plenty of leg room and as a short haul flight works well. However from landing in Moscow to reaching Shanghai was awful. Transit through Moscow is embarrassing - one desk with rude and unpleasant staff. I advise you to run off your plane if you have a quick connection because I have no doubt that they don't co-ordinate transit passengers and the plane would leave without you no effort made to fast-track those with short connections. One desk one security machine. The plane from Moscow to Shanghai was late and outdated with less legroom than the short haul flight from London no entertainment and food that was awful. Unfriendly cabin crew. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong. Yes it is cheap but there is a reason why it is cheap.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,

I have to say out of all international airlines I've flown Aeroflot is the most out of date with their entertainment technology. The seats while old were leather and soft and I slept for the first time on a flight. Hong-Kong to Moscow was 1.5 hrs late due to winter storms. Trip to Shanghai was on time and the plane almost empty so every passenger could occupy an entire row. The food was average and the staff do not smile but that's just the culture. I would fly with them again one of the better airlines in the cheaper price bracket.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,
2422,,Economy Class,,,no,,,,,4,6,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,Andy Williams (Spain) 31st July 2011,unk,Aeroflot are not a bad airline though I do feel that for the most part it's fleet and it's service offerings are several years behind those of the competition. I flew Barcelona - Moscow and was swayed by the price. The first leg was in a fairly new airbus A319 with comfortable seats and a clean interior. The only thing of note was the general demeanour of the crew who did nothing to make me feel welcome and were almost hostile in their dealing with the passengers. The pre-flight safety demonstration was multi-language and clear and I found most of the crew spoke English with no problem. In flight refreshments offered were a variety of fruit juices only. Alcoholic drinks are not available though after almost pleading I did get a diet coke. The meal was among the worst I have tasted in my many years of flying. The second leg Moscow-Shanghai was a real eye opener. The Aeroflot website shows that this flight is operated using one of its newer A330 aircraft with in seat entertainment but checking the entertainment listings I found that they been updated for 4 months. Not important of course but an indication of the haphazard approach to service. When I actually boarded I found that the flight is actually operated by (and has always been) by one of the airlines older Boeing 767 aircraft. Aeroflot Boeing 767's are much older than the rest of their fleet and come with little in the way of comfort or amenities. None of our seats or others around us would recline more than 2 or 3 cms. Walking up and down it was clear that no seats offered any noticeable ability to recline. They also had no adjustable headrests. All in all it was a very uncomfortable 11 hour flight. Added to the discomfort was the fact that there was no personal entertainment offered. The aircraft used the old system of large screens placed above the seats around every 10 rows. There were movies played - in Russian often with English subtitles however the quality of the screens and the placement made it an unpleasant experience. Once again the refreshments and food were very disappointing. The omelette breakfast was the only edible thing I had all other food was very poor. The staff on this second flight were more attentive than those previously. My return journey was merely a reverse of the outbound - equally as uncomfortable and equally poor food. The only significant difference was that I had coffee poured over me by one of the cabin crew who gave me a towel to dry my now soaking trousers but still failed to apologize or help in any other way and finally they lost my luggage and once located failed to get it to me for almost a week.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,

Check-in and inflight service was excellent in spite of our very limited Russian skills. Good inflight meals at no charge. We had switched our overseas flight from Aeroflot to Delta because of poor Aeroflot reviews (should not have done that). The return Moscow-JFK Delta flight was 3 hrs late causing many on the plane to miss connections at JFK while two Aeroflot planes left on time and made their connections.

It sounded good when we booked it but realizing that we would have to run through security and the length of the airport to get to our flight we didn't think it would be possible. We stopped to ask a woman behind a customer service desk and she said ""yes not enough time"" waved her hand at us and we were dismissed. Getting onto the plane to Delhi we realized our seats were not together. We once again tried to get an answer and was ignored. Very unhelpful and rude. For the return flight we had to change flights in the office in Delhi. Come to find out that there was another flight out of Moscow with a 3 hour layover. We switched to that flight. The office workers in Delhi were also cold and rude. As it turns out by the time we landed from Delhi in Moscow and got to the terminal to fly out that 1 hour layover flight had already left. We would have been stranded in Moscow for who know how long because nobody would have acknowledged our existence let alone get us onto a flight. Oh and did I mention I had ordered veg. meals?

I tried to explain to her that on a code sharing flights I am governed by the rules of SAS not by Aeroflot rules. But she did not want to listen repeating again and again that she knew the rules. Eventually after a long verbal exchange she called the authorities and found out that I was right. In the Aeroflot lounge - which I was entitled to use in lieu of SAS lounge - the employee on duty refused to let me in. She sent me to the other end of the airport where the people sent me to another lounge and each refused to let me in. The employees of the Aeroflot as it turned out did not know their own airport: they did not know any telephones to call nor they had any directories at and they did not know even the telephone of their own lounges in different part of the airport nor were they able to provide any reasonable assistance. Eventually at my insistence one of the supervisors after calling around for 10-15 minutes found out that I was indeed eligible to get into the very first lounge. The same girl who did not allow me in eventually had to call and find out that she was wrong. She never apologized.

One machine - a real embarrassment. Airport is a 19th Century with coffee costing £5. We needed some help with finding a gate. I approached 6 airport staff - all were abrupt rude and unhelpful (I am bi-lingual and tried both languages). Staff in the plane were polite but still no smiles as in other airlines.

Flight smooth except for passengers attempting to remove heavy bags and dragging every other object out of the overhead with it. Upon landing in JFK we were delayed getting to our gate. While we were stopped passengers got up and got their bags and raced for the exit. There was no effort made to stop them because of the size difference with the FA's. Plane was new and seats were reasonably comfortable. I feel sorry for Aeroflot staff having to deal with stubborn and highly combative passengers.

I had 4 attendants then check me in and one was waiting at the gate to see that I was OK and to tell me to checkin again at Seoul for my flight to Sydney. The flight was fine food was good and the service was fine. Russian airports are very difficult at the best of times I only speak a little Russian but I have travelled with Russians and it is also difficult when there are problems for them as customer service is terrible one.

Aeroflot is unable to cope with the passengers requests for clarification and the assistant who manages the Transit office is only able to say that she cannot tell anything to anybody and that passengers should just hear the announcements and watch the displays. Needless to say the announcements are barely audible and spoken in a language which hardly resembles English and the displays report incorrect information. We happen to discover by chance that Aeroflot dispenses meal vouchers which passengers are able to receive only after long and exhausting queues. The worst part is when the flight Moscow-Beijing is actually announced at 1630 on December 27th. No information is given as to who is allowed to access the airplane and this causes chaos at the gate. After some time rumors spread that only passengers with a ticket for Dec 27th flight will be admitted as well as some people with the ticket for the Dec 26th flight. After a couple of hours in wait at the gate an announcement of an Air China flight to Beijing has the result to disperse part of the crowd mostly Chinese but when we go to the gate joining the others we notice that the monitor at the gate reports a flight to Antalya. Therefore we go back to the Moscow-Beijing gate and after pushing and shoving we are admitted into the airplane with no apparent logic while other passengers are left behind. What has happened is really beyond comprehension and I discourage anyone from flying Aeroflot which is the worst company that I have used in my entire life.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,
2447,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,7,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,Jared Weaver (United States) 22nd January 2011,unk,JFK-Moscow-Kiev. Food and drink were free unlike many American carriers and found the food to be quite good. I did experience a horrible lack of organization and enforcement of the rules. No one would take their seat and flight attendants would not intervene to get things moving faster. Thus my flight from JFK was 20 minutes late taking off. Other than that the service was professional. Dinner was served quickly along with several rounds of drinks none of which were alcoholic. During landing I experienced the same disorganization and lack of enforcement of rules. When were on final approach to Moscow a woman entered the bathroom and would not leave. There was some attempt at removing her but not nearly enough. The flight to Kiev was more of the same passengers refused to take their seats until the plane was actually moving. There as little to no attempt by the crew to seat them. Our flight was delayed over a half hour because of this. Inflight service was good perhaps better than the flight between JFK to Moscow. Despite the short flight a meal was served and drinks came frequently. Overall my complaint was the lack of effort to get the passengers seated. The flight attendants knew enough English to make ordering food and drinks easy despite me not knowing a word of Russian.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,

I agree! I flew one way from Yerevan Armenia to Moscow and on to Los Angeles. New Airbus planes good leg room and above average meals. The flight crew seemed like they would rather be elsewhere and were not very interested to assist when someone had taken my seat. I had to stand for a while and then took matters into my own hands and found another seat.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,
2449,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,Y Kiselev (Norway) 19th January 2011,unk,"Oslo - Moscow - St Petersburg return. Fine crew meals and planes. Boarding in A319 in Oslo took some 40 minutes most of which were spent inside the aircraft waiting for other passengers to take their seats - thanks to lack of management and guidance from the cabin crew. Due to this arrived to Sheremetyevo D with a 35 minutes delay cutting my connection time down to 40 minutes. Passport control /customs very fast. Waited for luggage about 15 minutes. Ran to the transfer desk where two of the three staff said they can offer re-booking for a later flight to LED. However the third representative was extremely helpful did few phone calls to warn the gate that I am coming and basically ran with me through the corridors carrying my luggage to the LED flight gate. Unfortunately the flight to LED was delayed people were standing at the gate for 40 minutes hearing no info but only ""5 more minutes!"". Finally the gate personal announced cancellation of the flight and we were rescheduled for the flight departing in 2 hours. On the way back from St Petersburg everything went smoothly I even did not need to pick up my luggage at Sheremetyevo for customs clearance. Service and flights were just great. Aeroflot does change for the better but has to put more effort into ground staff training and customer service. English training for the crew is necessary as well. As for lack of smiles - I guess this is simply a cultural feature - Russians generally reserve smiles for situations of fun and/or pleasure and apparently Aeroflot staff do not feel much of either at work.",Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,

As a result I reached Stockholm on December 28 - after waiting in Sheremetyevo for more than 2 days and nights without any information food or lodging. The electronic screens displayed misleading information about many flights that were delayed or cancelled. I found out that my flight was about to depart merely by chance from my fellow travellers. After registration it was impossible to find any representative of Aeroflot in the international terminal D - they were just afraid to get out to the angry crowd and when they finally ventured they could not answer any questions and would not give their supervisors names. The new beautiful terminal is a mess without those who are responsible for customer service. I felt trapped and betrayed.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,
2451,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,Timo Kauppi (Netherlands) 11th January 2011,unk,Amsterdam to Bangkok via Moscow Sheremetyevo. Amsterdam to Moscow can be compared to a flight with any European airline you get even a warm meal. Moscow to Bangkok was excellent service was good even though the crew did not speak good English. Announcements in English were very difficult to understand. You get a warm meal twice and in between drinks and snacks. The selection of drinks is awfully poor for a long haul flight. Aeroflot does not serve any alcohol on flights to Bangkok but they also have not replaced those alcohol drinks with anything else. You are served only Cola Fanta Sprite water tomato juice apple juice or orange juice tea and coffee. Inflight entertainment was excellent with many films and games as well as music. The only negative thing we could find was the fact that Russian passengers do not take safety matters very seriously. We heard mobile phones ringing and passengers going to use the toilet during approach! Apart from the routine announcements and checking seat belts the crew was not interested in telling passengers to behave.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,

I tried Aeroflot again and my decision was made on the basis of the facts that they use new A330 on their longhaul which is a big step forward compared to their Il96 Russian aircraft and Aerflot flights and Skyteam partners moved to the newly opened Terminal E and D in Sheremetyovo which is supposed to shelter the passengers from the horrors of what is now called Terminal F. The flight from BKK was okay check in was problem free the boarding process was chaotic as usual and staff completely uninterested to help. To my horror we parked at the older terminal and it was the same story all over again. Horrible terminal with sad staff barking at passengers overcrowded old terminal with people sitting on the ground. I consider it as false advertising and clearly the airline lied as my reservations stated all flights were to fly to/from the new terminal. The A330 new and still clean onboard entertainment limited but okay a small number of films and a very limited music choice. The food was good and portions sufficient only one drink then totally zero cabin presence. After the meal the crew hid for at least 8 hours at the back of the plane and ignored many calls for service. They shamelessly kept hauling business class food for what it seems as their own private party at the back galley. Toilets filthy as no one checks on them. The same thing at the return flight. Beware that Aeroflot Bangkok flights are predominantly family oriented so there will be a large % of infants on board which can get very tricky with a plethora of babies yelling all through the red eye flight in unison. Aeroflot's greatest weakness is in its crew - sad robotic and no eye contact whatsoever. Thanks for the flight but I guess Ill give someone else my business until I see a considerable move forward from Aeroflot.,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,,

Both on the way there and on the way back, we faced a series of problems that negatively affected our trip. On the way out, our scheduled flight to Buenos Aires from Guarulhos was scheduled to take off at 10:50 am. However, we were abruptly informed of a delay with no clear guidance on how to proceed. During the agonizing wait time, we received conflicting information about departure times, and promises of meal vouchers were not fulfilled on time. This forced us to spend our own money on food. To make matters worse, our flight was ultimately cancelled, and we faced difficulties in reaching Aerolineas employees for clear information. After an exhausting wait, we finally received a voucher for a hotel. However, the instructions for finding the bus to the hotel were confusing, and company staff seemed to be disrespectful of our situation.  Upon arriving at the hotel, we discovered that Aerolineas Argentinas had only paid for the outward ticket, leaving us with unexpected expenses for the return to the airport. The following night, we faced another long queue at the airport and missed our connection to El Calafate, without any hotel paid for by the company. We were instructed to request accommodation at a hotel in Buenos Aires, but were only given a voucher for breakfast at the airport. This resulted in an extra 10 hours of waiting at the airport, putting a damper on our planned tour. On the return trip, we faced an additional problem, as the stopover in Córdoba was not informed on the ticket, resulting in a 1-hour delay upon arrival in São Paulo. In short, our experience with Aerolineas Argentinas was highly unsatisfactory due to delays, cancellations, lack of clear communication and inadequate support from the company. We do not recommend choosing this airline for future travel.  Nossa recente viagem com a Aerolineas Argentinas nos dias 6, 7 e 11 foi uma experiência profundamente decepcionante. Tanto na ida quanto na volta, enfrentamos uma série de problemas que afetaram negativamente nossa viagem. Na ida, nosso voo programado para Buenos Aires a partir de Guarulhos estava marcado para decolar às 10h50. No entanto, fomos informados abruptamente de um atraso sem orientações claras sobre como proceder. Durante o tempo de espera angustiante, recebemos informações conflitantes sobre o horário de partida, e promessas de vouchers para refeições não foram cumpridas a tempo. Isso nos obrigou a gastar nosso próprio dinheiro para alimentação. Para piorar, nosso voo foi finalmente cancelado, e enfrentamos dificuldades para encontrar funcionários da Aerolineas para obter informações claras. Depois de uma espera exaustiva, finalmente recebemos um voucher para um hotel. No entanto, as instruções para encontrar o ônibus para o hotel foram confusas, e funcionários da companhia pareciam desrespeitar nossa situação.  Ao chegar ao hotel, descobrimos que a Aerolineas Argentinas havia pago apenas a passagem de ida, deixando-nos com despesas inesperadas para a volta ao aeroporto. Na noite seguinte, enfrentamos outra fila longa no aeroporto e perdemos nossa conexão para El Calafate, sem nenhum hotel pago pela companhia. Fomos instruídos a solicitar alocação em um hotel em Buenos Aires, mas recebemos apenas um voucher para café da manhã no aeroporto. Isso resultou em 10 horas extras de espera no aeroporto, prejudicando nosso passeio planejado. Na viagem de volta, enfrentamos um problema adicional, já que a escala em Córdoba não estava informada na passagem, resultando em um atraso de 1 hora na chegada a São Paulo. Resumindo, nossa experiência com a Aerolineas Argentinas foi altamente insatisfatória devido a atrasos, cancelamentos, falta de comunicação clara e apoio inadequado da companhia.

Catering is very basic usually - example: ""Breakfast"" flight of 3.5 hours, leaving at 05:10 served a cup of still water and a small ""health"" bar. No options like other menu for sale items. Crew disappeared after service. Cabin baggage seems to have no item number control but is weighed rigorously.

Has to be the worse product flying from South America to the US. Here's why: Product - dated angle-flat seats on a 2-2-2 set up. Most seats were worn out and clearly hadn't been cleaned in a while. Amenity kit very basic and neither the bag or products were branded (vs Coke Hann on AA, Tumi on Delta, Ferragamo on LATAM etc) Food - much less than basic. On the return I was better off having a quick meal at the airport than on the plane. Service - here's my major concern, if I'm paying a lot for business class, I expect friendly service and attention to detail. Anything I wanted I had to ask for it, they would take my glass of wine while they were still half empty and wouldn't ask if I wanted a refill. I had my food tray done for a long time before they picked up Entertainment - basic, ~30 movies (most of them old or Argentinian films). Forget about noise cancelling headphones. Overall impression: I would definitely avoid Aeroloneas as much as I could. I decided to fly with them since I'm a Delta Diamond and wanted to get them miles and Delta only has an overnight flight from ATL to EZE This airline is way overdue for a makeover.

Very modern plane with LED ambience lighting, good entertainment screens with a good selection of movies and music. Sounds great so far right? Well, the downfall begins with the amount of leg room Aerolineas Argentinas have on this plane. I take long haul flights at least 3 times a year and have had experiences with various airlines but I have never seen a plane with such little space as this one. It was really uncomfortable the whole time because of the limited leg room (I am 1,79 cm). Unlike my other flight on this trip with Aerolineas, the food served for dinner was horrible, I didn't eat it at all, worst food I have ever seen on a long haul flight and I heard other passengers complaining about it as well.

First at the counter in Bogotá they made a big fuss over size, but this particular TUMI bag does fit maximum accepted standards. They insisted I fit it in the thing to measure it and when they saw for themselves it did meet size requirements, they insisted to weigh it and told me to either take out the 2.3 kilos or have it checked. This when on Copa and Avianca they let me take it in on board in Economy, no questions asked, and this was business! On the inbound flight they had 3 counters in Buenos Aires with SkyPriority signs, but all 3 were unstaffed.

Hilarion Martinez (United States) 30th July 2015",unk,"My flight to Buenos Aires was not full, plenty of room to stretch. Flight to Miami was full because of school vacation, big mistake on my part. The A330 is uncomfortable in economy. When the seat in front of you is reclined, you have the tray table pitted against you stomach, even if you are not fat. The flight attendants should ask everyone to sit upright when serving meals on the A330. Rows are so close that it is impossible to get up from your seat normally. One must slide to the end and climb out. I have flown this aircraft before and they are all the same in Economy - horrible. Considering how packed the flight was, the flight attendants were excellent. The food was mediocre with two choices: pasta or beef, and very small servings. Flight attendants provided drinks generously and water service was available throughout the flight. Bathrooms were kept fairly clean. Movie selection was very good, free headphones were provided. A very uncomfortable aircraft, avoid the A330 Economy. Only seats that looked spacious were the exit row seats. Check-in at EZE was smooth despite crowds and airport chaos.",Aerolineas Argentinas,A330,5,

M Studzinski (Poland) 5th July 2015",unk,"Flight was delayed 1 hr due to late arrival from Buenos Aires. I used Alitalia Lounge in Terminal 3, modern, large, with limited food options (salads, sandwiches, desserts). I was one of the first to board the plane, so I had to wait almost 30 mins to get any drink/welcome drink, without asking for it, FAs started to give drinks only after boarding was finished. Seat was ok, not full flat, but quite comfy. IFE very poor, only 5 channels available, showing only 2 movies in Spanish/English version, no Air Show with a map available, so had no idea about flight time etc. Cabin crew were nice and smiling, quite senior and during breakfast service, looking very tired and grumpy. Disappointing menu - I was expecting some local dishes from Argentina, some beef etc, and I got green salad with parma ham, risotto or pork with ratatuille or ravioli. I tried first two - all tasted the same, bland, boring, over cooked. No cocktail service at all, as only whisky is available. Good wines. Service in business class is very old fashioned, reminds me service from the 90s, nothing modern as for plating, food presentation, menu etc. Dirty toilet in Business Class. Breakfast started 2 hrs before landing, again - boring tray with fruit salad, yoghurt, bread roll and almost shapeless croissaint, jam and hot omlet with... carrots. Horrible. Generally, very poor business class product. No PA from pilots for whole flight. Not recommended.",Aerolineas Argentinas,A340-300,1,

The seats are very uncomfortable they do not have enough space between them vertically. My husband is 6 feet tall and his legs were touching the front seat he had no space to move them. I am 5'5 and was also uncomfortable. It was a long flight almost 9 hours and the TV screens did not function properly. Mine had no image whatsoever. My husband's screen had image but no sound. No entertainment at all for almost 9 hours is ridiculous. We had to take a second flight from Buenos Aires to Bahia Blanca and the flight was delayed 2 hours. On our return from Buenos Aires to Miami the flight was also delayed this time for 1 hour. Even tough the prices of Aerolineas Argentinas are lower I would never use it again or recommended to anybody. I have taken the same flight route with American Airlines and LAN and they are much better.

Well I'm happy to report that with Aerolineas Argentinas you don't ""get what you pay for"" you get much more. The plane we took was an elderly Airbus that was a bit tattered (especially the bathrooms) but the seats were lie-flat and comfortable the food was above average (much better than American) and the flight attendants were cheerful professional and happy to help with a smile unlike the surly overweight lazy tenured FAs on most U.S. legacy carriers.

Ground staff in both airports terrible neither courteous nor willing to help you. My greatest concern is flight attendants: most of the cabin crew and I mean 90% were rude they got angry if you requested a glass of water or soda (even though you walk to the aft galley to do so).

Luggage did not arrive in Buenos Aires for four days. Return flight delayed by 3+ hours resulting in missed connection. (All flights including connections on Delta were booked through Aerolineas Argentinas.) No help from Miami staff re-booking connection on partner? Delta. Ground staff in Miami sent us to the Delta counter to figure it out for ourselves. Delta would not rebook without us paying for new flight ourselves.

Others in our party of 5 flew coach. We had the full Monty flying Aerolineas. But the staff handled us well. Flight out left on time but no accommodations for Sky Priority passengers. Charge the gate at JFK was more like it. The food was very good. Service is prompt in that every flight attendant worked to get the job done so they could disappear. We liked how they gave us 3 options for our meals. The ice cream for desert and/or cheese plate were fantastic. And it is true they don't offer mixed drinks. For water they gave us a bottle for the over night flight. Breakfast was again very prompt well presented and the crew when prompted did go the extra step. On the return our child's vegetarian meal was missing. The crew promptly reviewed the menu and told us additional items we could choose from. For the return our flight was changed to add a stop at BRC. At which time we were notified our return to JFK was delayed from 11 pm to 6 am. Sky Priority line did nothing to help us here. We had to suffer with the rest. However they did rebook our last segment with Delta for us and effectively communicated to the crew in JFK to assist us and they did! They offered us a hotel and dinner in EZE. As we missed our JFK connection back to MSP they put us up in NYC and paid for dinner there as well. We turned down the offer for the hotel room in EZE and were able to sleep in the Club Condor Lounge. This is easily better than most First Class Lounges I have seen. Aerolineas in my opinion did much more than Delta United or American would have done for us. Our kids got to spend time touring NYC for the night. Our only downside was the plane could have been cleaner. Sad for a new A330-200. Here the domestic carriers do a better job. For the price we paid on for the ticket and what we got it was well worth it. When this airline makes mistakes they make up for it.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,4,

Never experienced any delays in fact we were actually moved forward from a 6 hour change at EZE to a flight departing 5 hours sooner for no extra charge.

Finally at 1:45am they announced that flight was cancelled. Passport control was closed. Also there were no baggage claim staff. Aerolineas Argentinas decided to reschedule the flight to 6:10am (7+ hour delay vs. original time). After changing the gate and the plane the boarding started at 6.45am and flight left at 7:30am.

A small snack was served by very friendly cabin staff and all was well until the beverage cart rolled by and we asked for some Malbec wine and were told that Aerolineas do not serve wine on domestic flights! One can imagine my surprise that after paying USD $992 per ticket that the flag carrier of Argentina which grows some of the world's finest wines does not showcase this product onboard-they did not even give us the option to purchase wine on a two hour flight!

Welcome on board was very friendly and helpful. Seats are flat but at an angle; very uncomfortable and I kept on sliding downwards. Inflight entertainment was good in terms of equipment but mediocre as far as programming both audio and video.

I found the seat to be hard and the angle for sleep was not comfortable. I put the seat into a cradle configuration and was able to relax more and sleep for several hours. The food needs improvement - presentation taste and variety were all lacking and considering the price paid to sit upfront I expected better. The entertainment system was good. There were a lot of movies to chose from. There were several places to charge my devices. I would fly with Aerolineas again.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,4,

I bought the ticket online but their website is not set up to allow you to select your seat. So I called their 800 number in the US. I called for 3 days several times each day before someone answered the phone. This agent's English was so bad it took 20 minutes to select my seats. EZE airport check-in at Buenos Aires is chaos. On AeroA all passengers for the MIA flight stood in a single line to be checked-in for only that flight. The same for other flights. We found this out by asking other passengers what to do as there were no AeroA employees or announcement boards present. There were long long lines of passengers snaking through the terminal. Check-in was so slow we were concerned we would miss our flight even though we arrived 2 hours early. It didn't matter though because our flight was delayed 3 hours on a crystal-clear morning. When we arrived at MIA 3 hours late the AeroA gate agents had gone home and there was no one to help us with rebooking our connections to Chicago. The planes both ways were run-down and old on the inside. On the way down a ceiling panel rattled the entire 9 hours. The entertainment system did not work either direction. The flight attendants only appeared 4 times in 9 hours: to serve drinks after takeoff to serve and collect dinner serve and collect breakfast and hand out immigration and customs forms. My advice: 1) Do not fly Aerolineas Argentinas for any reason even if you have to change your travel plans to avoid them or pay more on another airline. 2) If you are unlucky enough to use them and have to fly out of Buenos Aires EZE airport arrive 3 hours early and prepare for the slowest and most disorganized check-in procedure you have ever experienced. 3) If you do not speak Spanish then you will receive only limited customer service on the phone and their web site is primitive. 4) Prepare yourself for old tatty airplanes with no working entertainment system and largely-invisible flight attendants.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

The seat at the club condor are ok not flat bed but ok. We were welcomed with orange juice a cheap champagne and candies. The menu says only one appetizer (no choice) and 3 main courses. Two options are for the breakfast time. The whole experience with the catering was horrible. From the presentation to the quality the food did not respond to a business class. Do not expect to have any cocktails since they only have wine beer and whisky. The dessert was a piece of rock (ice cream) and we received hard croissant and bread in our breakfast. The returning flight did not even have all three dinner options and the food was horrible as well. I wonder how do they plan to compete with such a horrible presentation.

Their website is so primitive it is impossible to reserve seats. Their toll-free number is not manned 24 hours a day astonishing. On our plane to Buenos Aires none of the in-flight video worked for the entire flight. There was a loose panel in the ceiling over an aisle and it rattled the whole 9 hours. The food was mediocre even by airline standards. The flight attendants were businesslike but disinterested. The plane was only about 1/2 full but the FA's were often nowhere to be seen. Our flight back was 3 hours late leaving EZE after a chaotic check-in at the filthy Ezezia airport. At Ezezia you do not stand in one line for all flights and go to the next available agent. Instead there are separate lines for each flight no indication of which line you should stand in and the agents appear when they feel like it. There was no explanation for the delay and no apologies. If you have any other option for flying between the US and Argentina I would take it.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

The check-in at Sydney was slow and inefficient. There is no online check-in option for this flight and no seats are allocated prior to check-in so though you should only need to be there 2/3 hours before for an international flight I actually was told to get there 4 hours before just to get a decent seat and even then I queued for nearly an hour to check-in. Boarding was smooth and uneventful. The plane was clean but old. The in-flight entertainment system is horrendous. Considering this is a 15 hour direct flight there is no seat-back entertainment system. There is one large monitor at the front of the cabin and a few smaller ones spaces sporadically. The picture quality is terrible obviously no option to select subtitles if you are not a Spanish speaker. The movies were the same two films on repeat for the 15 hours. Nothing else. The food was adequate though the ran out of some food options leaving my companion to eat vegetarian or nothing else. Obviously the wine is good - it's Argentinean - but the drinks are just served with meals. If you press your call button it is ignored and switched off. I gave up trying to get some water. Breakfast was terrible none of it was edible. Flying back EZE-SYD was not much better. Check-in was a little easier and fortunately this time I managed to get a window seat. Upon boarding I discovered the plane was not full so I had two seats to myself. The only good thing to happen on this flight. The food was just as bad the availability or lack thereof of drinks was the same as before. The toilets were filthy and were obviously not checked or cleaned during the flight. The call-buttons were again ignored. The entertainment system was the same again this time they showed two English language films with Spanish subtitles a slight improvement but still the same on repeat for 15 hours.

Fl 1880 was postponed to 8.50 then to 10.30 without explanation. Then told the flight would leave at 3 pm. The flight didn't leave at 3.00 we were then told 8.30pm. What happened at 8.30 pm the postponed time for the scheduled flight is something out of a movie. We were never told that the flight was cancelled we were just told the flight would not be taking off. 2 hours later we were transported by bus out to the tarmac to board our plane to Ushuaia. After stopping at Trelow and taking on more passengers we were scheduled to arrive in Ushuaia about 2 am on 12/20. Landed at a small airport. The captain then for the first time announced that we were in El Calafete instead of Ushuaia. In the early morning hours of the 20th we are waiting in an unscheduled airport not knowing when or if we would arrive in Ushuaia. 2 hours later we board a plane and much to our relief we arrived in Ushuaia at 6am. Needless to say we did arrive at our cruise on time but we had one change of clothes to last us a whole 8 day cruise.

When we did finally reach the front of the queue we were offered an alternative flight for 5 days after the original flight date and were not offered any compensation in terms of a snack or alternative accommodation. Their attitude throughout was ""it's your problem"". On our final flight back to Bogota they changed the flight time from 6.30am to 5.20am around a month before the flight. We turned up 3 hours before the flight as instructed on the ticket only to find no check-in staff present. We waited 1 hour before a single representative turned up and when I asked why staff weren't present to check us in at the time that we were requested to be there I was told ""it's very early"". This was another example of their attitude towards customers. As a result the flight was delayed by 2 hours. In conclusion the customer service levels at Aerolineas Argentinas is a joke.",Aerolineas Argentinas,,2,

Arrived at the airport at 12.00 facing a long queue due to problems with check in system. Around 45 min prior the flight departure while still queuing for check in they announced our flight cancelled. They made us wait until 19.00 to tell us that we had to come back tomorrow for more info. We were given no food not hotel organised. Staff at the airport were arrogant refusing to speak English to non Spanish speaking customers and uninformative. Never again!,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,
2565,,Economy Class,,,no,4,1,4,,2,3,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,A Leal (United States) 31st December 2013,unk,I was on the inaugural flight to Buenos Aires from JFK and while the service at the airport was great and went through without any hitches the service on the flight was horrible. The flight attendants had such a bad attitude and passengers flicked on the service light for the entire flight and not once did I see someone respond. They basically served dinner and then left the cabin for the entire time until breakfast. I was dehydrated and not feeling well and wanted some water and didn't see anyone come so being that I was in the window seat I flicked the service light and after an hour of waiting I finally went to look for someone all the way at the back of the plane and they were all sleeping (it was 7pm). It was such a bad service experience that I will sadly never fly again and recommend that no one else fly either. You have one chance to make an impression and they really blew it with me.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,4,

The cabin was dirty pieces of sticky food on the small video screen. Numerous AR employees and ex employees meandering around the business class cabin socializing with flight attendants and members of the crew certainly not helping the already poor service they were delivering. Multiple FAA safety violations. Example: people standing while the aircraft was moving luggage obstructing the pitch during take-off and landing etc. Service was awful. In addition to leaving 5 hours late it took them 2-3 hours to serve the first drink. When they finally came by with drinks I ordered a whisky. The flight attendant explained they did not serve whisky until after lunch and that that she did not have any whisky in her cart. She did not have the Shiraz wine that they listed on their menu either so I settled for whichever red wine she could give me. Lunch was mediocre and immediately after the service all flight attendant disappeared for about 7 hours until they brought the ""snack"". Not even a glass of water throughout the flight. Finally while sleeping the flight attendant woke me up because the back of my seat was ""bothering"" the passenger behind me probably because the seat was ""defective and reclined too much"". The whole point of paying for business class is for the seat.",Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

Of the seven one (Salta to Buenos Aires) was cancelled but postponed as a new flight the second (from Buenos Aires to Trelew on the same date) was cancelled and the passengers left on the airport overnight for 10 hrs. There were no announcements and the new flight never appeared on the board. We were given a chance of free dinner at a pizza place on the airport but no hotels. We foreigners pay more than twice of what locals pay!,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

The NYC-EZE flight was delayed more than 8 hours. Luckily they emailed me before I set off to JFK airport. The problem is that they forgot that we had a connecting flight and did not make any provisions at all. Calling the Call Center to try to find out what to expect once in Ezeiza (stranded for 24 hours with two young kids? sent to a hotel? put in a different flight from the domestic airport?) was total waste of time. They don't even bother to pick up the phone. In summary: only fly Aerolineas Argentinas if no other option is available. They are unreliable have no customer service whatsoever and will not hesitate to leave you stranded. And never expect an apology.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

Something bad has happened every single time. Aerolineas Argentinas has a near-monopoly in many Argentinean markets which is very unfortunate. On my most recent trip the flight schedules were changed an astounding 6 times within 3 months of departure with the final one being a cancellation of my flight and a new departure from a different airport. Once you do have an actual confirmed flight the chances of it leaving on time are close to zero. My personal record was an 8-hr delay causing me to miss my connecting flight back to the US.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

Mixed experience first flight left at 2.40am from Rio to Buenos Aires on an Austral Embraer 190 and due to heavy turbulence there was no inflight service whatsoever on the 3 hour flight no apologies at all from the crew which I found rude. Short hops from BA to Montevideo and back uneventful. The return legs were better. Flights left and arrived on time crews on both Embraer 190 (Austral) and B737 did their job well.

No entertainment other than outdated TV hanging from ceiling distorted picture and mainly in another language that could not understand. Seat in front of me was broken and was on a constant lean. The staff or should I say lack of it spent more time talking to one another or reading a magazine than attending to the passengers. The flight home was no better - it might of been cheaper but had I known what they were like I would of gladly paid the extra and flew with Qantas. I would not recommend that you fly with this airline I certainly will not.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

Flew Sydney to Buenos Aires in a plane that looked like it was from the 60's. It was filthy on the outside and inside was even worse. When I opened my blanket on the plane it smelt. The staff were almost non existent during the entire flight. For the price I paid spending a few more dollars to fly with a competent airline with modern planes would be completely worth it.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

Great value for money if you don't have high expectations of the airline in the first place. Flight to BA was fine. No delays and food ok. The flight back however took off 2.5 hours late and then stopped in Patagonia with no explanation as to why so all up the journey took over 18 hours instead of 13.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

Have to say was very surprised on the outbound flight as the crew were very nice and attentive the food was good and the ""new"" business seat OK. The inflight entertainment was the flight map since nothing else worked. The cabin was tatty but clean so all in all ok marks for that. The return on the other hand lived up to everything I have read. This crew would put to shame any US crew when it comes to sitting in the galley doing nothing. Food was terrible and yep got a thimbleful of wine. Glad it was overnight so I got to try and sleep but that was hard given the number of families that the pilot FA's and gate agents brought up to the business cabin.

Flight was delayed until 9.30am then until 1pm didn't leave Argentina until 2.30pm now stuck in Sydney airport on the floor because Qantas have a cut off time on the weekend and Aerolineas Argentinas managed to get me after the cut off time when I was supposed to be here at 5pm! If there is another airline out from Argentina I would take that instead if this one. Even the flight entertainment is poor. You don't get your own screen so you're stuck watching these old tvs that the worst picture known to man. The only good thing was that I got 2 seats to myself. Probably because everyone knows not to fly with them!,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

Condor class was not a lot more expensive than economy given the 16 hour trip. We had plenty of leg room and the food was excellent. The seats and everything seemed to function. Flights were on time and our luggage arrived on the carousel. Check in was speedy. As other reviewers noted the planes are old so I needed a cushion for lumbar support and we took tablets with books and movies downloaded. This worked very well with excellent picture and sound quality. Staff perhaps could have done more to keep others under control eg a couple immediately behind us watched videos on their laptop with no earplugs so we got the full sound while we were trying to sleep. Given the reviews we were pleasantly surprised with the trip.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

We had no problems with any of the flights. They departed on time and our luggage arrived safely. Check in was super fast. The planes were reasonably modern and staff service OK. Food consisted of a snack box which was adequate for a short haul flight. While the flights were expensive prices were reduced considerably by purchasing discounted tickets before we arrived in Argentina. Given the reviews we were pleasantly surprised with the flights or perhaps we were just lucky. There was certainly nothing wrong with them.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

A couple of overhead locker taped up with do not use notices. The TV that I could see did not work. Didn't see the cabin staff smile once. Seats are tired and sagged. Food was good though I had taken bits to eat but the meal we got was good. No in flight services after the meal but drinks and snacks available. On the way back we were at the airport 23 hours before the flight (due to our connection) and requested a row of seats together. Couldn't check us in as check-in opened 3 hours before. When we checked in 3 hours before we were sat in different seats over the plane and told there were no available seats! Managed to get the children sat together and myself and my wife were in separate seats. On return the plane was in a slightly better shape a little newer. The TV was working but lost the red so some interesting colours for the films. Reasonable films and one channel in English. Food was again good. The cabin staff were great. All smiles and they came round every couple of hours with water/juice. Value for money was excellent.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

Passengers asked to wait in a lounge then abandoned. No staff for several hours. After 6 hours we got a rapid announcement in Spanish. Passengers were English-speaking Australians! BA to Auckland was unpleasant. TV screens were not working well. The girl in front of me ordered a vegetarian meal as did I. Of course they did not have it. They never have vegetarian meals. The hostess actually argued with the girl and told her that it was her fault that the meal was not ordered. The final insult was a 4-hour delay at Auckland Airport.

This flight was delayed a couple of hours but the staff were pretty good. Once I arrived at Sao Paulo the service was not as good but still okay. Staff seem tired and run down. Staff at the gate could not decide which gate the airline was at. If your a person of English speaking background and don't know much Spanish or Portuguese it pays to find someone to translate. I flew to Curitiba and the service was excellent and staff were friendly! We arrived on time. On the way back my flight got delayed and was going to be diverted from Buenos Aires due to poor weather. A nice stewardess kept me informed of this. Staff were very professional with the delay too. Overall a great experience.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,3,

We flew Club Condor class ex SYD. Before buying the ticket I researched the airline so I would know what to expect. It exceeded my expectations. Got the above ticket for AUD 3700.00 The only sectors in economy were AEP-FTE-AEP. Of the 7 flights all left on time except one and that only was delayed 20 mins. Food was great service was great.

No delays service wasn't that bad and staff were friendly. I wasn't able to eat the food served because my agent (nothing to do with AA) forgot to send the request for vegetarian food (must be done when the booking is made) and they didn't have much options for non- meat eaters.

2594,,Business Class,,,no,1,1,1,,2,unk,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,B Jays (Australia) 28th April 2013,unk,We flew Club Condor (business class) from Sydney to Buenos Aires and then on Austral (regional airline) to Rio and back. It is obviously an airline of a country in economic crisis. Aircraft used on the SYD-EZE-SYD route is like stepping back into 1975. Big old recliner seats (not flat) 3 scheduled movies on a continuous loop. No laptop power etc. The service is very basic to other carriers. AA club condor service is similar to what's offered in economy on other carriers. This is an extremely long flight close to 16 hours yet AA still doesn't use their brand new Airbus with lie flat beds I believe this is used to Madrid and back for obvious reasons. The crew on all sectors didn't really want to be there. EZE-SYD is one of the longest flights in the world made even longer by the aircraft and the service. We would choose to go with Qantas/LAN via Santiago in future trips to South America.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

Yes it's an old aircraft and the seats are only the old lounge chair type. Also the entertainment is limited. But they are replacing the A340-200 with a 300 series later this year so that should solve these problems. The business class check in was performed meticulously and lounge access given at both airports. Priority boarding was strictly enforced. The on board service was friendly and very personal. My coat snatched away and hung up as soon as I arrived at my seat. The catering was adequate and appropriate for such a long flight. Main courses were presented and served from a trolley in the cabin. They did offer fast track on departure but not on arrival. Still the airport in Sydney was so quiet it was unnecessary. One small criticism is that the Sydney arrival cards were in Spanish. Not easy for us Aussies. The price paid for the ticket represented unbelievable value. I'd fly the again without hesitation.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,2,

Food out on the night flight was okay but could only have 1 half glass of wine. Trip back again no online check in be at the airport 3 hrs before but had to stand around for 50 mins before any processing began. Was told 3 weeks before the flight it would be delayed 20 mins - got to the Airport it was shown to be 1 hr delay but eventually the 8.30am flight departed at 11am. Food was dreadful but this time could get more than 1 glass of wine. There was no explanation as to why the flight was delayed. Experienced similar on Austral (a subsidiary) had to be there 2hrs before and it still departed late. Iguazu-Salta cheese sandwich offered which was thicker - the bread or cheese? No online check in but their adds tell a different story.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,2,

There was no facility for web check-in or to have our seats pre-allocated prior to check-in. We arrived more than 2 hours prior to the flight to be told that the only way we could sit together was to take 2 middle seats in the centre row of the plane. The A340 has a 2-4-2 configuration. In such a configuration 50% of the seats are aisle seats. However it appeared that almost all had been pre-allocated prior to the ordinary check-in opening. In the end we were offered an aisle and a middle seat in the very back row. It is time that Aerolineas recognized that families are entitled to expect to sit together on long haul flights without having to take the worst seats on the plane. Other airlines manage to do this why cant Aerolineas?,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

The seats are rock hard but with better leg room than many. No on-line check-in or seat selection. No early bag drops on transfers meaning I had to wait for 3 hours at EZE before passing through immigration. (At 2am.) No in-seat entertainment and the two in-cabin screens-and sound - only worked part of the time. The same low res movies shown in both directions. The food coming back from EZE was the worst I have ever had on an airline with a tiny dried-up croissant tiny hard roll and insipid yoghurt offered as breakfast and pasta with a teaspoon of tasteless tomato sauce for lunch. I could not even get any pepper when I asked. Red wine was good though. Food out of SYD was much better. Excellent new terminal C at Ezeiza and 57 nice new aircraft in Argentina - pity these advancements don't extend to the Australian part of the operation. Contrary to a lot of the other reviews I found the staff to be friendly and helpful.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

Food was ok with snacks and drinks which you had to get yourself. Great views of the Antarctica if only the staff would let us see most of the flight the shades were kept down. Bring your own entertainment but they did show a couple of movies. For $1200 round-trip plus 2 internal flights I really can't complain.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,3,

Almost 30 domestic flights and no cancellations only one significant delay (3 hours) due to airport strike. Service good to excellent free snack (5-8 dollar value to US domestic standards) beverages offered once or twice (even on flights under an hour) Flight attendants friendly and efficient.

The only flight that left on time was the one out of Sydney. First and last time flying with AA. Delay in BA to Santiago due to not wanting to fuel the plane in the rain. Delay from Santiago to BA no idea why. A supposed delay of 22 mins which turned into just over an hour from BA to Sydney which caused me to miss my connecting flight. So overall not happy with the experience. Also trying to check in at Santiago to fly to BA took the check-in lady well over half an hour.

The aircraft used for this route are old but seats are as comfortable as other airline's with more legroom than most. The meals were adequate if not great with ample self serve snacks. Drinks available throughout the flight and the service was polite and friendly. Taking my own entertainment (on a tablet) was no problem considering the savings being made on the price of the tickets compared to the prices charged by the competition. I also caught several Aerolineas regional flights in South America on new aircraft as it is are in the process of adding new aircraft to its fleet.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,2,
2606,,Business Class,,,yes,3,4,4,,5,8,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,Blair McRae (Australia) 8th October 2012,unk,We flew on direct flights Sydney to BA return in September 2012 - the attraction of a lower business class fare than competitors and a direct flight swayed us into trying the airline. The outward flight left early from Sydney and arrived early in BA. The return flight left 30 minutes late but picked up the time on the way home. On both sectors the service was prompt and efficient. Food and wine was good but not presented as top tier carriers would present. The entertainment system was archaic limited and not on demand. This is well documented by other reviewers. We took kindles and an ipad and once we watched one movie we were quite happy to read and play. Views of the Antarctic ice sheet also kept us amused on the way home. Seats are old style business but we did sleep nearly 9 hours on the night flight on the way over. If this one experience is the norm for this sector I would recommend the business class offering given the price advantages - you can overcome the most significant weakness (IFE) by buying movies for your ipad and you can buy plenty for the saving in air fares.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,
2607,,Economy Class,,,no,3,3,1,,3,2,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,Neil Cluff (Australia) 16th September 2012,unk,A340-200 SYD-EZE. I felt like I have stepped back in time when flying with this airline. They need to update the seating in the older aircraft. Very little attention is paid to safety carry on bags were left unsecured on seats during take-off. Seats were broken and reclined without pushing the recline button. Despite the seats being broken passengers were permitted to use them. There was no personal entertainment and it is strictly bring your own. Before and soon after take-off the cabin became very cold. Approx 1 hour into the flight the seat belt sign was turned off for the first time shortly after staff delivered the food. There was no choice of meal (chicken or red meat) let alone a vegetarian selection. After dinner the food trays were collected and the lights turned off and all passengers were expected to sleep. The staff must have also turned up the temperature as the aircraft cabin became very hot and stuffy. The flight was 14 hours and passengers were expected to sleep 10 of those hours. Approx 2 hours before landing the lights were turned back on we were fed again and the cabin became very cold. Trays removed just in time to land in Buenos Aires. Staff were seen at the rear of the craft playing on laptops and not offering any drink runs to passengers.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

The lack of IFE was an obvious flaw but my tablet computer lasted the whole journey so it was ok. The food wasn't great but the white wine was superb. Staff were very nice and even though I was Australian flying from Italy they all spoke perfect English. Flying Aerolineas was very much what it was like to fly domestic in Australia in the nineties - not great but bearable.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,
2609,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,3,,5,7,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,U Grant (Australia) 4th September 2012,unk,I recently flew with AR on the new direct SYD-EZE service. I must say after reading the previous reviews here that I was pleasantly surprised. Flights were on time cabin crew were friendly (more so on the return leg) seat pitch in economy was actually very good cabin was clean and tidy. Yes there are no back of seat entertainment screens but for the price you cannot expect 5 star services. If being entertained is an issue bring your ipad or a good book! Food was OK. On the return flight after dinner service sandwiches were self- served from the rear of the cabin and it would be beneficial here to at least offer a selection (for us veggies rather than the ubiquitous ham and cheese). Overall the flight was as good as any for the price – in fact the worst part was actually going through customs at EZE  which took well over an hour. I thought I had landed at LAX! Overall I would recommend this airline if you are after a well-priced airfare – just don't expect 5 star amenities services for a 3 star price.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,
2610,,Economy Class,,,no,3,2,4,,4,4,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,J Butcher (Australia) 28th August 2012,unk,I flew from Lima to Sydney via Buenos Aires. My flight in Buenos Aires was delayed 1.5 hours but Aerolineas did not communicate with us at all! They announced a couple of times in Spanish thank you for your patience but that was it. Finally when we boarded it took another hour to take off! The people on my flight were complaining of the terrible service they had already experienced with Aerolineas. When I arrived in Sydney I had missed my connecting flight and so had half of the passengers I was with. We all had to pay for new tickets to our next destination which cost me $170 to Melbourne! Their entertainment was poor they played the same movie over and over and when passengers asked for help staff ignored them! Pretty bad service is an understatement.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,
2611,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,3,,4,8,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,T Adelaide (Australia) 28th August 2012,unk,SYD-EZE-SYD. Plane is an older A340-200 - without personal IFE - just a main screen. Economy class seats were generously sized and I was offered an emergency exit seat from SYD-EZE. EZE-SYD was a standard economy class seat. Plane departed on time from SYD-EZE and again EZE-SYD. Staff friendly and always walking around. Food was edible but there wasn't much of it. A small self-serve bar in the galley provided water and snacks during the flight. Both flights the plane landed on time and overall was a pleasant experience. Despite being limited in features I got from SYD to EZE and back cheaply comfortably and if you bring your iPad/iPod you'll be entertained. If there was no price difference between AR and LAN/Qantas etc. consider going on the latter. But AR isn't a bad airline provided you've got some personal entertainment on the long 13-15 hour flights. One final point - the AR website is incredibly hard to navigate and use. Calls to their SYD call centre go without answer.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,2,
2612,,Economy Class,,,yes,4,4,3,,5,8,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,Aditya Vashishta (Australia) 28th August 2012,unk,Well after hearing a lots of negetive comments about Aerlineas airlines I was a bit apprehensive but the fare was almost half from MEL-RIO. I found the service better and aircraft was old but with more legroom. The crew was also good and trying to help passengers as it was a long flight of 16 hrs. Food was OK and they should improve their entertainment service. Overall we enjoyed and would definitely go again.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,2,
2613,,Economy Class,,,no,,1,1,,1,1,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,A Smith (Australia) 20th August 2012,unk,They delayed my flight by 3 days and were incredibly rude and unapologetic. I was supposed to fly from Sydney to Buenos Aires via Auckland and Santiago. I turned up at the check in counter in Sydney and was told the flight would be delayed because the plane hadn't arrived yet from Auckland but it would only be a couple of hours. When I returned they said the plane would not be arriving after all and that we would not leave Sydney for another two days. Staff were rude and unhelpful and once we were taken to the accommodation we didn't hear from them again except for a piece of paper under the hotel door telling us to be ready at 5am. After two days we went back to airport there was no staff member there and we had to go from counter to counter trying to find out which flight we were on. After finally checking in and going through immigration we were at the boarding gate when we were told that we would not be flying out after all as there was no plane to meet us in Auckland. No staff representative. I ended up changing to LAN Chile who were excellent.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,
2614,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,4,3,,5,6,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,Ahmad Daoud (Australia) 26th July 2012,unk,Return flight (Sydney-Buenos Aires). The fare was really competitive. Flight left on time from Sydney to Buenos Aires. Food was below average (Fish and rice for dinner and very small sandwiches for breakfast and middle snack). On board entertainment is the worst entertainment I have witnessed. Flight attendants were nice. On my way back flight delayed 30 minutes. Food was good (Chicken and rice for lunch. Croissant tea and fruits for breakfast and small chicken sandwich for middle snack). On board entertainment was better than the first flight. Pros: Excellent price - On time flights - Friendly staff. Cons: No personal entertainment nor good screens - Bad food on first flight - Staff didn't allow me to use my iphone in flight mode - not very tidy (though not dirty).,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

Both long-haul legs were close to being on time but the baggage wait in BA was around 40 min (thus missed the transfer bus to the other airport in BA and had to get a cab). Upon arrival at AEP I was checked-in for the flight to Rio as normal. But 20 min after the schedule boarding time everyone was informed that AR decided to switch the departing airport back to EZE (and this is already at 10pm). So had to re-clear the custom collect our baggage wait for 30 min for the bus take the 1 hour bus ride to the other side of the town re-check in and re-clear the custom at EZE (which took 1 hour). Finally landed in Rio at 3.30am 4 hours late. No compensation was offered whatsoever. The return flights were relatively stress-free. Overall the cabin service was above average but planes are antiquated with no personal entertainment but a leaky roof. Breakfast on the 13 hour long-haul consisted of two pieces of cold bread and a banana. Much cheaper than LAN but definitely not worth the money paid.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,
2617,,Economy Class,,,no,,1,1,,,1,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,P Sorli (Norway) 15th July 2012,unk,Was booked on the flight on the 13th of July from EZE-SYD (which does not go via AKL anymore). I checked- in and everything was confirmed with my seat etc. I was at the airport at 6am for the 8.30am flight. After 1 hour in line I was only half way down the queue. A little bit later other passengers bound for SYD were denied access. The following reason was given: the weather pattern on the route to SYD. Therefore they had to get rid of weight to have a lighter aircraft to make it the entire way. Later we learnt that they had given freight/cargo priority and consequently 80 of us were stranded with the next flight due 3 days later which only had 40 free spots. The employees only spoke Spanish which was hard for people who didn't know the language. Lots of ideas were thrown around but evidently the flight left without us. I had checked the flight the days/weeks before I was due to fly it and noticed that the flight always left EZE delayed by 1-2 hours which could be for similar reasons. Maybe they should go back to flying via AKL to be able to accept all the paid passengers. Their compensation was not good either and I (and several others) decided we wanted a full refund.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

No personal entertainment unit. Surly cabin crew with very poor service standards. Hardly saw FA's for the entire flight and no effort was made to prepare the cabin for landing. I also took an internal flight with this airline from BA to Ushuaia. On this flight the service was just as bad and my seat was broken. I will never use this airline again.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

When we checked in we were told that the flight was on time. Just before boarding time we were told that the flight was cancelled. We were told that all flights were full for 3 days but they would work on something. Long story short we stayed overnight at the airport (with 5 children) and the next day we were flown to Corrientes instead of Resistencia. We received nothing in compensation - no vouchers for food hotel or transportation - and not for lack of persistent trying. We did not even receive transportation cost for travel from Corrientes to Resistencia! We would never recommend this airline.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,3,

The international flight has the biggest leg room and is very comfortable. No TV's but not a problem - bring your own entertainment. Food is mediocre but drinks are served regularly. Internal flights are good - they new Embraers are great and the new B737's have suitable legroom. The Virgin sourced planes are tight in terms of legroom.

Given measly meal voucher at BA that bought me nothing much. BA Airport was horrible and staff unhelpful. I had no personal effects for 24hrs once I arrived in Rio.

Service on the long haul was great from reservation process through check- in and inflight. Airbus 340 from and back to Miami had spacious economy class seats and attentive flight attendants. Onboard entertainment on the long haul was rudimentary at best and food was the worst airline food ever. Embraer 190 used on subsidiary Austral between AEP and UAQ was clean: spacious and had in- seat state of the art entertainment and refreshments. Had mobility issues and Aerolineas staff went the extra mile to take care of me. Favourable contrast in ground service with US carrier on arrival back to MIA was notable.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,2,

When we decided to skip one of our destinations there were no sales people available to make the change. The change was done by check-in staff who were very friendly but clueless.

They lied to us about how long our flight would be delayed so they wouldn't have to pay for meals and accommodation. When we returned to the airport we found it was further delayed.

I pre-booked vegetarian meals months ahead and confirmed at check-in 3 hours prior to departure. But my name was not on list. The plane was old with poor TV and disappearing staff.

We reconfirmed this at check-in but upon entering the aircraft we discovered this not to be the case and we were not even sitting together. On the first flight the audio did not work on my seat and on the other the visuals were running without audio. Staff tried to speak English but generally had a poor capability so communicating in Spanish was more effective. Some staff were unfriendly and all staff disappeared for about five hours after serving the meal on leaving BA. Snacks and drinks were available in the galley areas but this was not announced so passengers only found out about it through diffusion.

There was a single screen for entertainment but no headphones were passed out during one flight until the movie had run! The movies were old. The food was decidedly average. The plane fittings appeared old - my seat bottom was entirely loose from its frame and two of the bathroom doors I used wouldn't close properly. The toilets were not serviced at all during the long 12 hours flights so they were pretty horrible by the end. The crew were friendly and bilingual but once meals were served they did not really appears. I wouldn't seek to fly with this airline again unless there were no other options.

2648,,Economy Class,,,no,4,1,1,,3,3,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,H Stamm (Switzerland) 9th December 2011,unk,"I took two intercontinental flights (MAD-EZE and back) and six internal flights with Aerolineas. All eight flights were more or less on time the planes were clean and baggage always arrived without delay but service on all flights was poor and food all but inedible. There is a difference between the internal and the intercontinental flights however: the cabin crews on internal flights were just indifferent and bored on the intercontinental flights they were rude and in some instances overtly hostile. Ground staff generally falls into the category ""indifferent"" with a few positive exceptions. Conclusion: Try avoiding Aerolineas for intercontinental flights but for internal flights it's ok.",Aerolineas Argentinas,,1,

But the price difference compared to other airlines more then made up for it. Foods was ok and the staff were good and if your prepared with a book then this is good value. Because the planes are older there is actually pretty good leg room in Economy. On my return I'd been travelling for 32hrs and they gave me an unexplained upgrade to Business Class. I was finally able to sleep and the service from the crew were great.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

When we finally got to the airport the boy I was travelling with was 'on the list' but I wasn't and was touch an go as to whether I would get a flight at all. All ended well as we finally both got back to NZ even though we were put on different flights.

The planes are evidently old and the entertainment system is very mediocre especially for a 13+ hr trip. The food given was good enough and the crew was nice although they didn't offer anything unless you asked them. The biggest problem was the schedule on my return flights the plane from Rome to Buenos Aires was delayed 6 hrs we had to wait 6 more hrs in Buenos Aires to get back on a plane to Santiago (delayed an extra hour). They were good enough to move me and my sister to Business Class from Rome to Buenos Aires because of the problems although this was possible only because my dad and uncle were in Business already. Business class didn't offer many improvements in comparison to other airlines the seats although more comfortable than the Economy ones weren't as good as other airlines and the entertainment system was almost the same as in Economy.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

However I am disgusted with the way that the airline has handled the problem with the Volcano in Chile. I understand that flights need to be cancelled but Aerolineas is not communicating with its passengers and is also not making any attempts to help those trapped in Argentina due to flight cancellations. The staff were very rude even getting up and walking away. It is such a disappointment to see the way that passengers are being treated. Those of us trying to reschedule our flights are having problems getting through to the call centre. Very unprofessional.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

They are by far the worst airline I have experienced. It is a very poorly run state owned airline acting like a monopolist. Customers are treated like dirt. Staff at check in is rude (Puerto Iguazu was the only exception). Flights are nearly always delayed without any explanation given or sometimes cancelled altogether. Even worse some of its planes are in very poor condition and seem utterly unsafe. Follow the advice of some Argentinians I met : always avoid them. It is better to spend 24 hours in a bus (they are very comfortable) than 2 hours with Aerolineas.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

I was surprised at the overall quality of the Aerolineas Argentinas operations : online check-in inflight service from friendly and professional crew and the snacks including the quick Calafate to Ushuaia hop. The radar went down at Ushuaia and AR sent three bus loads of passengers on a four hour bus ride to Rio Grande through a heavy mountain snow. As the buses arrived in Rio Grande the Aerolineas Argentinas flight landed and a completely full flight was airborne for AEP in less than an hour.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

We had to wait for 24 hrs for them to fix it and lost our connections to Mexico.

Waited in Auckland airport for 8 hrs before they ferried us out to hotel - dinner at 3am and had to be awake by 8 to go again (we had kids with us).

Food acceptable - I'm not fussy about food. Staff inclined to be offhand and more interested in socialising among themselves. Announcements very thickly accented English - difficult to comprehend at times. Cabin interior - on my first trip the reading light came away in my hand and the projected movie seemed to have been soaked in bleach before screening. On the second trip there was no film at all with no explanation or apology from the crew. Lateness - first trip OK. Second trip a shocker. Six-hour delay in leaving due to unspecified technical difficulties. On late arrival in Buenos Aires confusion reigned with passengers asking each other what was going on as most connections had been missed. By a mysterious process (no thanks to the airline's staff) I found myself on a coach with other mystified passengers thinking we were heading to a hotel for the night (it was very late). Instead we were taken to another airport and hastily put aboard another plane. I got to Brazil but landed in the wee small hours and faced an uncomfortable night sleeping on the floor of the terminal. Aerolineas thereby escaped having to foot the bill for hotel rooms.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

Our flight had been cancelled without an announcement. They rebooked us for a flight that left from a different airport and that took a detour through Sao Paulo.

Inflight entertainment is non existent and the food served well below average.

The flight was 90 minutes late. However this flight was better than expected. A340s used on this route are old. However the seats were comfortable and leg room acceptable. The complimentary light meal coffee and juice were tasty and appreciated. The cabin crew's English was quite good - some of the crew were young and friendly while there were a couple of more experienced and more gruff senior crew who shouted orders. All PAs are given in Spanish first then English. It was very hard to understand the English notices as the English spoken was heavily accented. There are no personal TVs and on this three hour sector no movies were shown - just the route map on the main screens. Their service is significantly lower quality than their main competitor LAN but they are also significantly cheaper. I think it would be less comfortable to fly the much longer AKL-EZE sector on this airline but for AKL-SYD they were fine.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

B747-400 used were really old no personal screens in the seatbacks only small ceiling screens. Furthermore on MAD-BUE flight the inflight entertainment system gave up working shortly after the safety movie so no movie or Airshow at all. Meal/drink service was absolutely minimal no drinks at all during both 12h night flights. Cabin announcements unmotivated and in bad English. The old fashioned seats were very comfortable. great legrooom and recline. Bring your own food drinks and entertainment don't expect anything special from the cabin crew but enjoy the comfy seats which are much better than those ultra-thin seats which most leading carriers offer today.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

Provided with a lunch voucher I spent the day at Sydney airport flight finally departed at around 1730. Arriving late to EZE I had missed my prebooked hotel shuttle and complained at the airline counter and they gave me a voucher for a hire car to my hotel which was nice. A340 was old seats were well worn and frayed overhead reading lights didn't work overhead baggage lockers difficult to close ancient entertainment system with flickering screen. Food was passable but nothing special cabin crew looked old and tired and mostly stayed in the galley chatting amongst themselves and were not very attentive. The pillow was so small and flat it was a waste of time as was the small think blanket. Every other flight I had within South America with this airline was very late causing inconvenience and disruption to my travel plans. My return flight to Australia was cancelled and I was driven to a hotel and picked up by bus the next morning only to face more delays uncertainty and poor communication from airline staff.

Inflight service OK there doesn't seem to be a choice of meal and it is just plonked in front of one. But had plenty of room as plane was only half full. Return trip from Montivideo was hours late leaving for Buenos Aires. I had to take a bus to the international airport but as it wouldn't have arrived there till 0100 I had to take a car (shared with another traveller) for the 0200 flight which left at 0430! Plane was better than the first as everything seemed to work. Cabin staff do their job but not so friendly as other air lines. Lights out after dinner and don't see cabin staff much after that but there is water and drinks left in the galley area. Plane late into Auckland so therefore missed connection to Christchurch and had to buy another ticket as I had just got a non transferable thinking 3 hours between flights would be long enough. Air fare was about half the price of the other airline servicing that route. Not sure if I will use them again. Have to be aware of delays and we were not given any explanation as to why it was delayed.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

Flight left on time food decent (two services on this 6 hour flight lunch and snack before landing) although the main lunch was pretty small and all types of drinks free. This airline has a pretty bad reputation for being late but it seems they are buying new planes and things are getting slowly better. For me it was all I could ask for - cheap nonstop and good service. The only change would be to have some sort of in flight entertainment.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

2703,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,5,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,A Blagrove (New Zealand) 23rd June 2010,unk,Auckland to Buenos Aires. Plane was delayed by five hours after we'd checked in with pretty much no explanation (except that the incoming plane from Sydney was delayed but again no explanation why). We were travelling with two young children so the delays were a bit difficult. Legroom was pretty much as I remember other airlines in economy class. The lack of decent entertainment was a pain (only the old monitors up in the aisles where you had to crane your neck to see) but the kids ended up falling asleep anyway. And the movie they played was in Spanish. Dinner was acceptable. Kids had a kids meal as requested. It was disappointing there was no beverage service during the night for those who were awake. I went hunting for a drink of water hoping they'd give me a bottle to tide me over but no just a cup. Having said all that the staff were reasonably friendly and the fare was much cheaper. It saved us around $1200 as a family. So if you don't mind no-frills it's not a bad choice. The domestic leg from Buenos Aires to Lima was on time and efficient.,Aerolineas Argentinas,,,

Aeromar is usually my airline of choice. On this day they were more than 2 hours late.

I thought that Aeromexico / Delta would just put me on the next flight. First, they made me visit different ticket counters which took another 45 minutes and at the end said that they couldn't do anything about it and I would have to buy a whole new ticket. The first ticket that I bought online cost me about $125 usd, but now this new ticket to LA cost me almost $300 usd. After I bought my ticket, went to the Aeromar ticket counter, which was in total disarray, and tried to talk with the supervisor. He gave me an email to write to and sent me on my way. Since then I wrote them twice and have received discouraging emails. Yesterday it took me two hours on the phone with them, going through 3 levels of management for them to give me a ""courtesy flight"" worth $80 usd and I still have to pay the tax. I ask them what would of happened if my whole family was with me, we would have spent $3,000 usd? He said that there is nothing that they could do, so much for customer service.

Despite numerous attempts to reach out for assistance, I've been met with nothing but callous indifference and even had the audacity of being hung up on. It's been almost a month since my bags went missing, and AeroMexico has shown zero urgency or accountability in resolving the issue. This experience has soured what was supposed to be an exciting surf trip, and I implore anyone considering flying with AeroMexico to think twice. They've demonstrated a complete disregard for their passengers and their belongings.",Aeromexico,Boeing 737-8 MAX,4,4

In my personal experience, this airline has demonstrated a lack of professionalism and reliability. One of the major issues I encountered is their frequent changes in flight areas without providing sufficient means for passengers to stay informed. The availability of screens displaying these changes is limited, and there is a notable absence of announcements in English or bilingual employees to assist non-Spanish speakers. During my journey, which involved a stopover in Mexico City on both the outbound and return flights, I encountered a distressing situation involving my 87-year-old grandmother. Aeromexico staff separated her from the rest of our party, despite the presence of completely vacant seats on one of the flights where we could have easily been accommodated together. When we approached the employees for assistance, they claimed there was nothing they could do, leaving us feeling frustrated and disappointed. Regrettably, the most appalling customer service experience occurred on our return journey, as well as on our way to our destination. All members of our travel group contracted a parasite during our trip. As we were boarding the flight, the airline initially announced that they would wait for a passenger in the bathroom, only to abruptly change their decision and close the doors, leaving us behind. It is common for groups traveling together to prefer not to leave anyone behind, and this unexpected action forced us to endure a gruelling 12-hour wait at the airport. Even after spending approximately $580 per person for the return trip, we encountered further rudeness from the Aeromexico staff during security procedures. Considering the involvement of three countries in our travels, one would expect a certain level of customer service, but unfortunately, Aeromexico failed to meet even the most basic standards. I strongly recommend exploring alternative airlines and investing your money elsewhere for a more satisfactory travel experience.",Aeromexico,,3,1

The following day I flew to PVR in economy class because business class was full. Arrived in PVR but my luggage did not. It arrived 2 days later. My review is not about the delays but the bad service of Aeromexico crew and ground service. Aeromexico flight attendants are cut and dry sort of unfriendly. They are not rude but they seem that they are not happy doing what they do. During the flight, some of the pursers talk too much. I like to have 1J seat and I constantly hear they chit chatting among themselves. Another annoying factor is that as a typical Mexican Airline, they love sponsors.  Ground personal, are the worst. They seem all so unhappy that I try to do my check in at home and not face them. Watch out, if you have a problem, then you are in trouble. Seldom they find solutions but try to make it more difficult for you.  If you are going to connect in Mexico City Airport, do yourself a favor, choose the fastest connecting flight, I think it is one of the worst airports I have been and don´t rely on Aeromexico Lounge. It is a lounge for anyone that pays a fee to get in. It is uncomfortable, crowed, noise and there is seldom any food to eat. If you are a frequent flyer with AM, you probably already realized that their mileage programe is a hoax. If you want to exchange for a business class ticket they ask in a R/T trip in some cases almost 1 million points. In economy if you are luck with 300,000 points.

The staff was amazing - professional, courteous, and very friendly (and still are with the obvious exceptions (mentioned below). Unfortunately, our recent trip leaves us questioning whether or not we will ever risk using their services again. If you have or have traveled with someone with, a disability, you know how important it is that boarding the aircraft be done in an organized manner. Those that have issues (health, age, children, etc) need that little extra time before regular boarding commences. It's not meant to be a free-for-all. Well, not unless you board your Aeromexico (AM) flight out of the satellite Mexico City airport, NLU (Santa Lucia). NLU is a relatively brand new airport (opened March 2022) and it appears that the AM staff has yet to be trained on basic procedures. We had 2 bad experiences in NLU. The first was flying in on the way to Veracruz and the second was the return trip out. While the first flight was total chaos, we were fortunate enough that several of the gentlemen at the front of the line saw that my husband was an amputee, etc, and immediately waved us to the front. While this was disorganized, it wasn't the mess that the return flight out of NLU was. The second flight, NLU to Guadalajara was a nightmare. There was absolutely no control over the passengers. When it was time to board, there were no zones or even basic pre-boarding. AM had a group of 20-30 who appeared to be traveling together (not young, disabled, etc) who were let on first. We were about halfway in the line. There was no Premier boarding -- one of the benefits that AM promises its passengers who pay a bit more. Nope, it was a cluster eff free-for-all. Oh, silly my. I forgot to mention not only does my 76-year-old amputee husband need the special boarding, but WE WERE also PAYING PREMIER PRICES for the early boarding. We didn't get it. So, we finally get to our seats and watched as there was no control as the passengers boarded. Several economy passengers just casually jammed their stuff in the Premier overhead bins. Result? Hubby had problems with his carry-on (which had his meds) and which came off badly scuffed. Please understand, I realize that space is limited on flights, but if you pay for certain benefits, you should get those benefits. We did not. I wrote to complain and got the stand ""too bad, so sad"" letter in return. I had asked for compensation. Of course, that's not going to happen. No, I wasn't looking for a free flight or reimbursement of our tickets. As my girl Judge Judy says, ""we ate the steak.""

While efficient in serving meals and performing basic tasks, not one crew had warm, friendly people that either welcomed you or smiled. They come across as some combination of angry and arrogant.

Not having any other recourse, and needing to get home, he reluctantly paid the exhorbitant amount that Aeromexico required. The next day, he called Aeromexico and told then that the money had been originally paid for the ticket and that he wanted a refund of the more than $400.00 that he was forced into paying. Their response was to offer to refund the $169.04 that was the original cost of the ticket. Note that offering that, indicates that they know they were paid originally and they knew how much.

It means we already waited here for 4,5 hours - the whole night for the flight. At the boarding time, they just pulled us back and said that they need to check our passports, so we had to wait at the boarding station for 10 mins for their checking.

We waited there for another 10 mins and they just shut the plane door, right in front of us, left us there and the plane took off.

We had a flight coming up and though we didn’t pay the premium airfare, we thought maybe with a medical emergency they would allow us to pay the cost and move our dates. I called customer service and was told no I didn’t get that type of ticket, but maybe send an email to customer service (makes no sense) and they would be able to help me. I send the email and get a confirmation number back saying they’ll be in touch in a couple of days. I waited 2 weeks. I tried to reach them via email and by Facebook messenger and all I would get is an automated response saying someone will be with me shortly. No one ever comes on. Finally, I got tired of waiting and left a bad review on their Facebook page. Surprise! I get a message asking if I needed help. They told me to send a document proving my case, which I did even though the hospital stated that’s a HIPPA violation to state her diagnosis like they asked. I get an email back saying sorry but you will just have to take the loss on your tickets. So on top of my mother in an induced coma for the last 4 weeks, I now lose almost $2000 in airfare.

On our flight from Chicago to Mexico City our bags were forcibly checked for being the “last to check in” even though we checked in via their app at 6am Thursday for a 12:30am Friday flight and then checked in again upon arrival at the airport at 7pm. This was the first flight to be delayed, the staff at the gate and flight attendants were beyond rude and unhelpful, and the plane ride itself was horrendous. Our flight home from Cancun to Mexico City was delayed for over an hour and we were not informed of this delay until we were supposed to be boarding, we still do not know why the plane was delayed. We had a connecting flight to make in Mexico City which we made them aware of and they promised 3 times that we would make it, Mexico City would hold the plane for us. We were told we would touch down in Mexico City at 6pm, instead we touched down at 6.37. Our connecting flight left at 6.50. We ran across the airport only to miss our connecting flight and play the game of how are we getting home. It was a struggle to find anyone in the airport in uniform who spoke enough English to understand us. Person after person just told us, we don’t speak English, sorry we can’t help you. We finally get someone to help us book a new flight that was 15 hours later. Aeromexico gave us vouchers for a hotel, transportation, and some food. Very generous, thank you. We get to the hotel they put us in to find out the hotel was booked up completely and we were going to have to wait 30 minutes to then be shuttled another 20 to a new hotel. By this time it was 12.30 in the morning and we had to be up again at 5 just to head back for our new flight. It was such a frustrating travel day. Our new flight starts boarding on time at 9am, we are so excited to be leaving and leaving on time until we sit on the plane fully boarded for 40 minutes before we even take off. Again, the flight was delayed. Out of 4 flights in total that we took on this one trip, 3 flights were delayed for at least 40 minutes. I do not recommend flying with Aeromexico and I especially do not recommend flying with them when you have a connecting flight. Your odds of making it are slim.

Inability to arrive/depart on time, lack of accountability, Lying to customers and blaming air traffic control for company delays to avoid issuing hotel vouchers, cabin crew who disappear during the flights. I arrived 2 hours ahead of departure time and checked in with no problem. I was told that flight was on time and boarding would start 320PM for a 4:10 PM departure. The plane arrived at 3:40 in Merida. Shortly after they announced that, the flight would be delayed until 5pm due to air traffic control delays. A big lie of course. Around 430PM the gate paged me and told me that I should not get on the plane because most likely my connecting flight would depart before we arrived. The gate agent manager said tough luck and refused my accommodation request. I opted to board and take my chances.  When we arrived my flight was still on the ground. But the pilot parked 3 feet short of the spot he needed to be and a tow truck took 15 minutes to move the plane another 3 feet. First class disembarked using the staircase, but then the staircase broke and another 15 minutes were required to get another staircase. Pilots did not inform the passengers about the bad parking job nor the staircase. My name was removed from the passenger manifest to Miami without even informing me or asking consent. The new flight was the next day. With me off the passenger manifest, my original flight to Miami could take off without me. After I made a huge scene in the middle of the hundreds of people waiting at the Mexico city counter, I was awarded a hotel room and 4 hours of sleep.

We finally left for an excursion, and at around 2:00 p.m. on October 8th, they called to say they were going to deliver my bag. No sorry, no apology. To top it off, my son had a velcro patches of Texas Flag and U.S. flag, they were both missing. The velcro was really strong and it was impossible that it had fallen off by accident. I wanted to call to get my $30 checked in baggage refunded, but you could not imagine how hard it is. I am probably going to place a chargeback.",Aeromexico,,,

There were delays (30-60min.) and the cabin crew was rude and unaccommodating. We don't speak Spanish and it was obvious that they had a problem with that. Especially one lady who was really nice to all Spanish speaking passengers but when I asked her something I got just one word answer in a really impolite way. Another flight with Aeromexico was supposed to be from Puerto Vallarta to Mexico City and from there to Vancouver on 25/Aug. As the first flight got delay almost 3 hours we weren't able to catch our second flight. Lady at the PV airport was unhelpful, and after we approached her, she told us that we had just 2 options. Stay one more night and take the same route next day, or take the first flight to Mexico city and wait there for the second flight to Vancouver till next day. We've been told that it wasn't Aeromexico's fault therefore they won't provide us hotel or meals. After we got out, to our surprise our original flight to Vancouver just began boarding right at the next gate. We happily get there to realize that we can not get in. Why? Nobody knows again. At first they told us because of ""weight and balance"" after that because they didn't have available seats and so on. It was two of us and another 15-20 people including families with small children who weren't able to get in. We were trying to understand this situation but after 30 minutes no reasonable explanation came. We accepted vouchers for hotel and meals as at the airport in Mexico city miraculously could provide them. Next day after we got back to the airport we were trying to get confirmation about the flight delay as we supposed to be already in the work in that time but we were stuck in Mexico. Of course customer service at the airport was as bad as the lady at our first flight so we got nothing. Finally 50 minutes after our flight was scheduled we were finally boarding, still not sure if we can get in this time. We got in and after almost an hour we started rolling and captain is speaking to us. Unfortunately we had to have a stop in Tijuana to get fuel. In the end this flight had 3 hours delay (+24 hours). I never heard sorry or any kind of apology till this moment. One more thing, after we got vouchers for meals and hotel we've been told that we can catch Aeromexico shuttle in front of the T2 gate which take us to the hotel. We've been there for almost 30 min. and what we've seen was just shuttle for crew. At the hotel we've learned that we should have vouchers for taxi too but we didn't have them so we paid 2 fairs with taxi by ourselves. I would like to see my money for this last flight back but after I read many bad reviews about Aeromexico I think I'll never see them again but I'm more then sure that I will never ever fly again with Aeromexico.",Aeromexico,,1,

I consider myself pretty easy going but Aeromexico really put my nerves to the test. I will just make a list: -My luggage was broken into and my jewellery stolen during my 5 hour layover in Mexico City on my way to Los Cabos. I reached out to the complaints department but not surprisingly no one has responded (weeks later). Upon my return to Toronto, I once again had a short layover for 2 hours in Mexico City. While lining up at the gate to get on the aircraft, the staff closed the door while 15 passengers remained behind standing, me and my family included. it was stressful, messy and confusing and the staff said nothing to us about what was happening, they just pointed a finger for us to go to customer service. That's when we discovered we had been bumped off our flight for the next 24 hours and they couldn't even guarantee us that we wouldn't be bumped again the next day. The customer service rep. explained that we couldn't go on the flight because of weight/balance issues, and that's when my husband and I came to the conclusion that passengers are being kicked off the flight in order to make room for more lucrative cargo. We collected our luggage for the 24 hour delay because after my initial experience, we did not trust our luggage sitting in the Airport with out them being rummaged through and items stolen. When we received our luggage, my bag was heavily damaged and a wheel completed ripped off so I could barely manage rolling it around the airport and to our hotel. The next day we checked in 3 hours before our flight because we wanted to avoid any issues. The line up at the gate was a crowded mess, it felt like I was going to get trampled on. Once seated and on the plane the crew made an announcement that a few passengers would not be coming on the plane again and that their luggage needed to be removed from the plane. So the airline was again doing to others what we experienced the day before. At that point, the passenger sitting behind me told the flight attendant that she just saw the ground crew taking her bag off the plane even though she was still on it, at which point the flight attendant left for a couple minutes and when he came back the plane just started to pull out and he said there was nothing he could do about it at this point. Once we arrived in Toronto Pearson Airport, and made it through customs, my husband and I discovered that our luggage was also taken off the plane in Mexico City. After filling out the necessary paperwork, the Aeromexico luggage attendant informed us that we should have our luggage delivered to us no later than Tuesday September 7th. It has been 4 days now since we landed, with multiple phone calls and emails made on my part, no one from Aeromexico has contacted us about its whereabouts. And after having my personal items stolen out of my luggage on my 5 hour layover in Mexico City, I can only imagine what I will or will not have left in my luggage if Aeromexico ever returns our luggage to us. However, my daughters luggage WAS on the plane, and upon returning home she discovered she still had all her items in her bag but she also had extra items. Shirts and skirts that did not belong to her, which means the baggage staff at Aeromexico is opening peoples luggage to look for valuables and is just stuffing personal items back haphazardly in random suitcases. That tells me that many people are missing items.",Aeromexico,,1,1

In July of 2020 I bought a round-trip ticket London-Cancun for a friend for travel in August. Three days later they cancelled their London-Mexico City flights for the entire month of August. I called to find an alternative, but they couldn't offer me anything, save for travel credit. When I said I wanted a refund, the agent said I'd have to write to a dedicated email address. The email was returned as undeliverable, so I opened a dispute through my credit card, figuring I'd get my money back that way. AeroMexico objected to the dispute, saying my fare was non-refundable; they said I had credit to use within a year, minus a $200 no-show fee. A no-show fee for a cancelled flight. When I finally fixed the problem with their email address, they said that since I bought the ticket through a third party vendor (in this case Orbitz) I'd have to get the refund through them. Orbitz was helpful, but said they still had to go through AeroMexico for their approval before issuing a refund. Months went by, and all Orbitz could say was that the airlines are very slow these days and AeroMexico was not responding. So they have the manpower to object to my credit card dispute and keep my money, just not the manpower to approve my refund. I wrote to them several times about this discrepancy, but they never addressed that issue, just repeating I'd have to go through Orbitz. Let me add, I tried to be understanding. I can see that the airlines are strapped. I said I would accept credit in place of a refund if I could change the name of the passenger (which the rules disallow; remember I got this for a friend) and if the credit were not time restricted (which, so far as I can see, just helps them out even more).

The flight AM 004 from Paris Charles de Gaulle to Mexico City on the night of 31 October 2020 was fine in every respect but one: after five hours in transit at Charles de Gaulle the day after France went into lockdown meant one could not buy a drink, cup of coffee or food of any kind as everything was closed. When supper on board finally arrived after our 11 pm take off for a flying time of 11 hours and 55 minutes, it consisted of a small dish of ravioli, a tiny roll, a mini Kit Kat bar, a sliver of cheddar cheese and a small pudding. There were no vegetables or salads and there was no choice (usually there are two for the main course). More than 10 hours later breakfast came in quite a large box but consisted of a mini croissant butter and jam and a another mini Kit Kat bar. There were some alcoholic drinks on offer - wine, vodka, rum and tequila but no gin or mixers. There was a very poor and very limited choice of new films on their entertainment programme.

The gentleman was very courteous, acknowledged our feelings and explained their policies regarding a refund. He then proceeded to inform us that Aeroméxico would, however, allow us to reissue the tickets for a later date; however, the flights would have to be rescheduled for a date no later than April 30th, 2020. At that point I e-mailed several letters to Aeroméxico Customer Service department and requested them to please extend the vouchers deadline (provided them with a time frame that would work for us) and explained valid reasons why we would not be able to travel within the time frame given.

But I find Aeromexico’s business practices morally questionable and their rules and regulations to be deliberately vague and lacking in transparency.

And at the same time people have to worry about meeting basic need and essentials [food, medical]. Then there are companies like Aeromexico who refuse to return their customers money when the service provider cannot provide a service.

I again started discussing with him, that this behaviour is wrong, changing the booked and additionally paid seats of the customers - but he just turned around and went away. Consequently i ended on the seat directly in front of the toilets, where the seat recline was much less, than on my booked seat - sleeping was a torture for this overnight-connection. My original booked seat got a woman with a kid of about 12 years, they blocked obviously the three seats and laid flat down all the way to Amsterdam. But it is unbelievable, that people, who paid additional money for reserving a seat are removed and moved to another seat, while others, who didn't pay and reserve their seat before, get benefits for free. They could have gotten those seats, but then they needed to pay also additional money for getting this comfort. The stewardess in the airplane was completely incompetent. I showed her the two boarding-passes and she just said in a rude way, that my digital boarding pass is invalid and now i need to move.

The issue in question involves a flight from Puerto Vallarta to Mexico City and a roundtrip from there to Quito, Ecuador before a final flight to Seattle. After landing in Mexico City for the layover, my next flight was cancelled due to unrest in Quito. Aeromexico issued a travel alert saying that they would not be charging for fare differences or change fees to handle the matter. They also advised me at the airport that they would not be flying into Quito for 5 days. As I was in now stranded in Mexico City, I asked to be put on the next plane to Seattle. This was all transacted in Spanish, which I am not completely proficient in. I expressed concern about making sure I was securing the value of my flight, and they prompted me to call the 1-800 number for the Houston office when I returned to settle that matter. As their travel alert read, I still have the roundtrip value of the ticket from Mexico City to Quito available to book. I called the Houston office on my return to Seattle to be told that I had already agreed to an itinerary change and there was nothing that they could do. They referred me to the complaint department (email only) to handle the matter. After asking for the value of my round trip MXC-Quito segment of my flight to be rebooked, it took almost a full week and a second email to receive a ticket number from them and another five days (and another follow up email) to receive their curt response detailing my implicit forfeiture of my trip value when I agreed to fly back to Seattle from Mexico City part way through this interrupted trip. They also said that I was not on the same flight or cabin and that the value of my trip to Quito was used to cover the difference. I do not see how this could be the case as I paid to upgrade my seats on all four flights in this trip and was still in coach on the return segment to Seattle. I received no print out showing how the value was distributed. So I'm told both that I agreed to sacrifice the value of my ticket, but that loss was implicit. Nothing about the scenario was explicit except their travel alert online which I was in the bounds of, and thus their decision on this matter seems only to be made in a cost-benefit to themselves. I find this sort of service disingenuous. The worst part of their email was the final statement: ""thank you for making Aeromexico the carrier of your choice."" I WILL NOT CHOOSE AEROMEXICO IN THE FUTURE - likely choosing Avianca or any number of similar operators along similar routes. Although when first using this airline I enjoyed the service and availability of routes, the double-talk between their official travel alerts, and their email-only handling of complaints in a non-customer-centric fashion leaves a lot to be desired by this airline. So for American and English speaking travelers I will also say that email communications leading up to flights and the majority of airline staff are predominantly Spanish speaking, and that if you find yourself stranded away from home, you may find yourself accidentally forfeiting value you purchased with the airline, or at least being told so later.",Aeromexico,,3,1

So, we booked our trip to Mexico through Delta Vacations (that part went perfectly, as usual). We not only booked our flights but we chose to go with Aeromexico on the way back. Partially because it went through Mexico City and we had an overnight stay and it was an airline we had not flown with before. To put things in perspective, we have flown with several other Delta partners in the past and have had zero issues (matter of fact, they were great! KLM, Air France, etc.). So, we thought that this would be the same type of experience and of course a new adventure. We were so incredibly wrong! We booked our flights in mid-June for the beginning of October and our seating assignments and everything were set to go (they were first class seats). Two days before our flight we checked both Aeromexico and Delta and the Delta seating arrangement was correct (nothing had changed) but Aeromexico had moved our seats (on both flights) to the very front of the plane, which we do not like because there is no place to put your hand carry (personal) bags so you have to put them above. Since Aeromexico was for a trip back we were told after spending over an hour on the phone that they would not change our seats until 24 to 48 hours before. This was interesting to us because they had already changed our seating on both flights to the front of the plane (without any warning). From what we understand after speaking with our Delta representative (because Aeromexico was almost impossible to get in touch with) this had been the second change they made to our seating without advising us or even giving us the option to choose. So now sitting in Cancun, Mexico (wasting more of our vacation) 24 to 48 hours before our flight back, we checked Aeromexico. To our great surprise, they had not only moved us again but this time out of first class and into the main cabin, which would be fine if that’s what we had paid for. So again (while on vacation), we get on the phone and waste our time with Aeromexico. Then after no resolution or better said waiting on the phone (eternal hold). We called Delta again, this call took an hour and a half and the Delta Representative was told by Aeromexico (the first time he called) that they would change us to a different flight. Then, after 15 minutes of no changes the Delta representative called back and he was told that not only would they not change our flights but if we wanted our old seats back or a different flight that we would have to pay. Of course, we refused (Who in their right mind would hand over more money?). We asked the Delta representative what his response was to them and he said that he took it to their management and they also refused saying the same thing. What it appeared to us is that Aeromexico was trying to upcharge us for services we already purchased. This should be brought up to the Aeromexico corporate headquarters, and used as training and a teaching tool on how to not treat your customer. Because we fly so much with Delta and because we think they’re just a better airline, the Delta Vacations representative took us off of the Aeromexico flights and found us flights home on Delta (for no additional cost and the same day!). We would not and could not recommend Aeromexico to anyone at any time for anything.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by Aeromexico, although my trip did not get off to the best start as their booking system is atrocious. Specifically, when booking multi-city trips (rather than a direct return), the website does not give you a choice of different economy fare classes, but just the one ""tourist class"" option. When clicking through to the payment page, the website tells you that one checked bag is included in the fare. However, once payment was made, the ticket sent to me said no bag was included! A check of the fare class rules confirmed this was correct, but the booking page was highly misleading. I then had to pay GBP 50 each way extra to check a bag. Not the end of the world given how cheap the original fare was, but this was poor for a supposedly professional company. I complained about this to the cheery check-in agent, who apologised but merely replied ""sorry, the website is terrible, isn't it?"" Not good enough! However, things picked up from there. The flight out was only 1/3 full in economy, so almost everyone had a row to themselves. I could stretch out across 3 seats and get a proper night's sleep. Flight was on time, crew were friendly and food was OK if not great. IFE had good, up to date film options on a decent screen. One of the best economy flights I have had - only complaint was a funny smell that appeared in the cabin from time to time. On the return leg, check in and security at Tuxtla was very efficient - it's a tiny airport. Domestic leg on an E195 was uneventful, although a longer flight than planned due to very high levels of traffic at MEX. Connection at MEX was seamless as there are no exit checks/passport control for domestic-international connections in Mexico. MEX terminal 2 is architecturally pretty cool and not a bad place to spend a couple of hours. Return flight to London was unfortunately completely full with no spare seats, so not as pleasant as the outward leg. There was also a delay of around an hour and a half after boarding whilst a technical problem was fixed, but captain kept us well informed and crew were friendly once more. Once in the air, food service was again OK and despite the busy flight I could get some sleep (the Boeing 787 is in my opinion one of the best planes to fly long haul, along with the A350, due to the better pressurisation/lighting and quieter cabin). The one annoying thing about this flight was the lack if responsiveness of the IFE screen. It kept trying to call an attendant instead of begin a film, or turn the reading light on instead of the flight map .. highly bizarre and irritating! So overall, I'd say Aeromexico were pretty decent and I'd certainly fly them again (especially at the price I paid), but there are certainly a few areas for improvement.",Aeromexico,Boeing 787-8,3,

I have tried to make contact with this business multiple times over the last month. This airline does not offer phone support other than for very basic assistance like sales. Everything else must be through email. However, my issue is they don't respond to their email. I asked for a tax to be refunded that I was never supposed to be charged as I was exempt from this tax, as well as a refund for a phone booking fee that I was not notified about until after the charge was completed. They responded to me that ¨everyone is notified about the phone charge, and that the tax would not be refunded¨. I replied on August 28th clarifying which tax I was referring to, I also asked them to review the call recording as they would hear that I inquired about the phone fee to be refunded while I was on the phone with the representative. The sales agent did not mention the fee. I inquired with him about the fee after seeing it on the receipt in my email. He told me the only way to receive a refund was to email the complaints department. This was during the sale, not in another interaction. Furthermore, I would have never made a phone reservation but their online booking system was having an issue and the error message told me I needed to call to complete the reservation. For this reason alone they should have refunded me that fee. However, I received no response to this email. I emailed again September 17th, to let them know that I was injured in an accident and would not be able to make the flight. I emailed them a medical certificate, and photos of my injuries, and I requested that they provide either a refund or a credit to be used on a future flight. They couldn't even be bothered to reply with a ¨no¨. Just no response at all. I later realized that my Visa Infinite card that I made the payment on came with trip insurance, so I filed a claim with my insurance company. My insurance company requested a letter from the airline stating that the trip was canceled. The airline did send this. However, after I submitted the letter to my insurance, my insurance company requested that the letter also include additional details. I requested a revision to the letter on September 23rd. However, once again, I received no response. Despite being routinely ignored by this business the only thing I am asking for is a document confirming 1. the cancellation of the flight, 2. the amounts reimbursed and the fines charged OR indicating that there will be no refund. Also, an apology for simply ignoring almost every communication with them would also be nice.",Aeromexico,,,

I must mention we did not want any money back, just travel date updates. The communication was all over email, there is no way you can talk to anyone from customer service, just people from sales department. Long story short I accepted to pay the U$350 and started looking into new dates and prices on their website, after my research I found out that the new price was U$771.48, this price is from Aeromexico website, so I decided to give call and book / re-schedule the trip with the new dates. At the time of my call the agent confirmed the price I got from their website but after telling them that I was just going to re-schedule and gave him my old reservation number they told me that the prices on their website which is the same price he gave me did not apply to me anymore, the customer service representative said that new tickets prices are different than change of date rates, and I had to pay U$879 for the change of date, U$350 fine and U$529 because the difference in prices, keep in mind on their website a new ticket is U$720 and I originally paid U$1024. Also, I am buying the same destination, same economy seats, same hours, just a different dates and paying the finds and difference in price is there is any, the same agent confirmed that in my case was better to buy a new ticket with the new days than re-scheduling the fly, can you guys believe this?

I made a 3-day trip to Peru for the death of a family member and on my return to NY they did not let me board the flight because I did not have an American residency letter in process. I had to take 4 extra days and pay almost $ 600 for the letter from the embassy, ​​which told me that this happened only because of the REGULATIONS OF THE AIRLINE. After this I tried to take a flight as soon as possible back to NY since I was losing many days of work, in addition to having left my 2 little children of 2 and 4 years and with whom I had many responsibilities. The airline did absolutely nothing to help me. On the contrary, they wanted to charge me $ 2000 for the change of ticket since the only available space was in premium class and that seat can not be sold ""like that"". Finally, due to the lack of empathy and support from Aeromexico, I had to buy another ticket in LATAM for $ 726 one way and FOR CERTAIN NEVER REQUESTED ME THE EMBASSY LETTER for which I spent 5 days doing the procedure.  ES: La peor experiencia de mi vida. Son totalmente inflexibles, el trato al cliente es pésimo, inhumano. Hice un viaje de 3 días a Perú por el fallecimiento de un familiar y a mi regreso a NY no me dejaron abordar el vuelo porque no tenía una carta de residencia americana en trámite. Tuve que tomarme 4 días extra y pagar casi $600 por la carta de la embajada, la cual me dijo que esto sucedía sólo por las REGULACIONES DE LA AEROLÍNEA. Después de esto trate de sacar un vuelo lo antes posible de regreso a NY ya que estaba perdiendo muchos días de trabajo, además de haber dejado a mis 2 pequeños hijos de 2 y 4 años y con los cuales tenía muchas responsabilidades. La aerolínea no hizo absolutamente nada por ayudarme. Por el contrario, me quisieron cobrar $2000 por el cambio de boleto ya que el único espacio disponible era en premium class y ese asiento no lo pueden ceder ""así nada más"" .

A complete disappointment, I thought Aeromexico was somehow a ""professional"" well managed airline but looks like it is not the case (no comparison to the average Skyteam standard). The Club Premier Lounge in Mexico City is a joke, I wanted to take a shower after my redeye flight from JFK and at front desk they directed me to the SPA: at 8AM the SPA manager told me showers would be available from 9AM, when I popped up at 9AM I was told by another representative that they never open before 9:30AM. As I got nervous and complained for that, she would eventually call the SPA manager and at the end they agreed that at 9AM there was another guest booked - who never entered the SPA so it went from joke to fraud. Boarding was an ""all in"" experience since the different boarding groups lines were not enforced. FAs nice but felt like an amateurs crew, with no shared guidelines on how to greet, serve or respond to biz class passengers. This ""confusion"" feeling lasted the whole trip, since I was skipped for no apparent reason from the pre-departure drink (at that point I was too tired to complain), after being served the main course I had to ask twice to have some bread as well, and drinks refills took forever; surely having only 2 FAs for a whole 32-seats business class cabin does not help. Food I would say average although options were limited (just 2 for main course, compared to 3/4 on most airlines). The seat was probably the worst part of this flight: really really narrow, somehow short when in lie-flat position (I'm no giant, 180cm/5,9 feet tall) so that I had to sleep on a side, the headrest is so thick that it gets annoying when you place the pillow on top of it as your neck innaturally bends. But most of all, the seat is not completely flat, there are some ""bumps in the wrong places"" that make it uncomfortable; luckily I asked for another comforter and placed it on the seat as some sort of bedding and it worked ok, otherwise probably I wouldn't have slept at all. Amenity kit on par with other airlines (probably better than AA shoe sack but no comparison to the new BA The White Company pack on Club World or Ferragamo on AZ).

Despite the SkyTeam rules, clearly stated on the website (false advertising when it comes to Aeromexico). Crew doesn't speak English on international routes. Transiting in Mexico city - beyond disastrous. I almost missed my connection. Airport is a mess, no signage, nobody speaks English. I had to clear the customs and border control, and then run around looking for my gate, just to pass another security control (which was useless and ridiculous). Cabin crew on YVR-MEX route was atrocious. Service non-existent. Aircraft was dirty, passengers were seated in business class just because they knew someone or spoke Spanish.

This is our 2nd time flying Aeromexico. Last year was a complete disaster with the flight that was supposed to leave SMF 2315 and land in GDL 0515, instead leaving SMF st 0530! The entire nite we were given zero info/updates and only once offered a drink. The shops were closed, and my husband, is a diabetic controlled by diet so needs to est every 2 hours when awake. No employee would help us. Our return trip last year was 3 hours late. I am usually a glass half full type of person, so when this years annual trip to visit family was being planned I decided to give Aeromexico another chance. The dates/times/prices were the most convenient so we decided to give it another try. We never entered a complaint last year. This year our trip to GDL was uneventful. But the return trip we encountered the ticket agent from hell. We were never notified that the weight per luggage piece had been changed, and the carry on that should have been free, was 2 kilos overweight. Under then new guidelines, our 2 large luggage pieces were a combined 10 kilos underweight. We usually pay $25 each for the large luggage. At the GDL terminal u go thru the first line, then are given a piece of paper, have to go to a 2nd area, wait in line to pay for ur luggage, then return to the first line provide ur receipt and get ur ticket, not very convenient or fast) nothing was said by the ticket agent about overweight luggage, but when I went to pay I found I was going to be charged $114 for the carry on, which was 2 kilos over by the new guidelines. I pointed out that our total was still 8 kilos under, and that we were never notified of revised guidelines to no avail. I refused to pay, saying I would rather move 2 kilos to another suitcase. I was told to return to original ticket person and that he would return our luggage so we could make the changes. When i returned and told him what I wished to do, he put all 3 pieces of luggage on the conveyor where it automatically rolled to the back, gave us a paper with UPC codes, and told us we could get our luggage back ""down the hall"". I asked him numerous times where down the hall and he refused to say more. We looked ""down the hall"" to no avail, and no other Aeromexico employee were helpful. We finally asked a Volaris employee who walked us to an area that we would never have found. It took almost an hour to get the luggage returned. We adjusted the weight, and then had to wait in the LONG ticket line starting the entire process all over. It's a good thing we always arrive early for our flights! When we got to ticket counter again, the carry on was .03 over. The ticket agent was prepared to start the whole have to pay for this deal again. I pointed out that the total was still 8 kilos under and her response was ""and what does that have to do with anything? "" I quickly removed 1 pair of socks which put it at 9.90 kilos, under the magic 10 kilos. We have continually encountered employees for Aeromexico that are rude, unhelpful, and basically convey a could-care-less attitude. The only time Aeromexico seems to shine is when you are actually on the plane. The stewards are great. Excluding a very rough landing at SMF (bounced several times before finally staying down) the in air experience is great!

Service was attentive and the food, while lacking in presentation, was edible. The trouble started upon arrival in Mexico City at 3am, where I was to connect to a flight on the same business class ticket, but operated by Avianca. I’d chosen this connection for its shorter layover time. The transfer desk in the arrivals hall at MEX was unmanned, so I proceeded on my own to the departure hall’s Aeromexico check-in area where I was told to switch terminals to check-in with Avianca. Since the monorail was not operating at that hour I was supposed to take a taxi. Once at the Avianca check-in counter it became clear that I was booked in economy to Bogota. Nowhere during booking was this evident (I even retraced my booking steps on the same connection at a later date to verify any mention of travel in economy). It seemed that the AV was already overbooked (i.e. known to Aeromexico) at the time of booking. Aside from the economy experience on a business class ticket, the less than smooth connection at MEX, Aeromexico took 6 weeks to respond to my complaint. Their Twitter account ignored me completely and when I received an e-mail response, let’s just say that, for the result, in the end I might as well not have complained at all. On the return flight, no connection issues, however the food both out of BOG and MEX was subpar and the service was distracted and messy especially on the long haul stretch.

After sprinting downstairs to Gate 48A on a mezzanine level I learned from another El Dorado Airport staff member not affiliated with AeroMexico (but still useless) that the boarding had closed and I had effectively missed my departure. I spent the next 30 minutes trying to track down an actual AeroMexico representative at which time I was told that the error was completely my fault, and that the best that AeroMexico could do was offer me it's ""deepest regret"" at my problem. The Bogota AeroMexico representative offered no solutions and ultimately took me to their back office in the airport where she proceeded to close a large door in my face, hide like a coward along with the rest of her colleagues, and summon security to escort me back to the main departure hall so that they could carry on with their day removed from my issue. Ultimately I had to book $1,500 worth of flights on United Airlines and linger around El Dorado for 16 hours before leaving on a 1:15am departure the next morning. AeroMexico has no interest in providing solutions to traveler problems; has no interest in acknowledging their error even in spite of overwhelming evidence including official boarding passes stating the correct gate, AeroMexico website screenshots for the flight showing the same gate information as my boarding card even two hours after departure, and pictures of two entirely different locations (see attached); and is entirely focused on taking your money and reservation and then letting you navigate your way through their processes without any assistance and at your own peril. Save your time, save your money, save your effort and sanity, and book your travels to Central and South America with any other airline if you can, even if the number of connections and time to arrive at your desired destination is longer, as dealing with AeroMexico is a textbook lesson in business incompetence.",Aeromexico,,,

We got to the airport at 945am and were at the terminal ready to fly out by 1015. However at 1245 they announced a delay. Every 30 mins they would report a delay. At about 230/3 they said some parts needed to be replaced but that the parts were on the 545 flight. They said the repairs would take place then and then we would fly out afterwards. At 645 some other passengers were commenting that the flight had been canceled. So we lined up and after another long wait we were told that indeed the flight had been canceled. 6 hours later!!! They offered to rebook the flight for he morning but said i would have to speak to a supervisor to see if they would be willing to get us a hotel for the night. They said they dont do it because we live in Houston. I live more than an hr away from the airport and we had been dropped off, not to mention bad weather had just started. We had to wait for our ride and ended up not leaving the airport until 945pm. We were there 12 hours! We honestly could have driven and made it to where we were going. Apart from the long wait, i was traveling with my toddler(yr and a half). After we had waited 2 hrs i asked if we could borrow one of the cribs used on the plane or heck even just a box would work. She just needs something to sleep in thats not wide open. The Aeroméxico staff member said they didnt have any and she couldn't help me. It was miserable because she couldnt take a nap. After 4 hra of waiting I went and asked the staff again. Different staff member told me there was a nusery with beds right around the corner. Are you kidding me? My kid was fussy and miserable and the solution was right around the corner? Heck for the long wait they could have at least fed us. Airport food is expensive and them saying here go eat wouldve been nice. I also wasnt told that when I pay for an infant ticket I get to check in a 50pound bag in for free. I ended up paying online for a bag, thats $25 I could have saved. We ended up not being able to fly out the next day because we still wouldnt make it in time for the funeral. So we asked to change the dates. They said they could but I had to go back to the airport and change the tickets there. So 2 days later I drove back to the airport only to find there was nobody at the aeromexico terminal. On the board it said there was a flight leaving at 1130 but the airport supervisor said there was only air china flying out. So another 2 hrs wasted. I ended up having to call and after being disconnected 3 times, 40 mins later they were finally changed. Again nobody said I see you paid for a bag but you’re entitled to a free bag. Nothing.

MEX back IAD and beyond was where AeroMexico showed its true colors. While attempting to board the plane we were informed that there was customs form that was mandatory to board. Absolutely our fault for not having these (we arrived 10 days prior and had discarded these not knowing how important they were). We were told that we needed to go back to the immigration office and get new ones and that it would take 5 minutes and they would wait. So we ran; and while sprinting back up to the gate they looked up; saw us approaching and proceeded finish closing the boarding door. We begged, pleaded, etc obviously to no avail. After that we were basically treated like dog sh*t to be scraped off a shoe and be rid of as quickly as possible. We were told by the gate agents (just rude angry people) ticketing agents (dead-eyed and uncaring) and supervisor (slightly more sympathetic but also completely unwilling to actually do anything for us) that immigration documentation is our responsibility, and as such we would need to pay $250USD per plus about $400 in fare difference (that's $650 each or $1,300 in total y'all) to simply get rebooked on the same flight the next day (it had seats available). Trying to get us on another earlier flight with a partner airline was completely out of the question. Uninterested in this extortion; we ended up paying for a hotel for the night and used points to book a return flight on a real airline. But hold on folks; it gets better! Our bags! They were checked on the original flight. Upon returning to the US I called their 800 number and got someone who told me that I needed to call the lost and found line (a Mexican number). This not sounding quite right to me (I had the bag tags and wanted them to just do a search and locate them) I asked if there was a supervisor I could speak to. I was put on hold; and after waiting for over an hour, ultimately hung up. The number he gave me to call is unsurprisingly not in service. At as loss for what to do I drove to the airport and went to the ticket counter (they fly one flight a day out IAD and don't have a baggage office). Here I found some nice people that actually tried to help. They did a search and told me the bags were still in Mexico City. ""Oh Wait, they didn't tell you?"" she says. When you don't board a flight that you checked bags on they're required to remove your bags from the flight before they depart! You should have been told to pick them up in Mexico City and recheck them on your next flight! They filed a request to have the bags brought up on the next flight and promised to call with an update on when that would be the next day. That was two days ago. They gave me a number to call and check on the bags. It goes directly to a VM box. I left a message. Not confident I'll get a response. There are thousands of dollars worth of climbing gear and technical clothing in those bags. I guess it's possible that I will see this all again but I'm losing hope.

Before boarding I was called up to the front desk by a AeroMexico representative, who I informed immediately I did not speak Spanish. He told me that I was going to have a random bag check and to step to the side. I agreed, as this was no problem. There was a second gentlemen in front of me who was also having a random bag check. When he was finished, I was told by another AeroMexico representative to proceed to the security woman to check my bags. When I gave my passport and bags to the security woman (who I also informed I did not speak Spanish) she waved me through without checking my bags and said I was free to go. I walked down the ramp as instructed and started to wait in line to board my flight. 5 minutes later, the AeroMexico representative that was working the ticket counter came screaming down the ramp, yelling my name and making a huge scene in front of everyone in line. He would not let me talk and was yelling at me that I should have had my bags checked. I was trying to tell him that the security woman had waved me through and that I had stopped like he told me to to have my bags checked. He would not stop yelling and also put his hand on my shoulder pushing me forward.  I was being treated like a criminal when I had nothing to hide and also followed his directions.

Flight was delayed by about 20 minutes because of it. However, when refuelling the plane, they miscalculated and had to start all over, delaying the flight even longer. After they finished we got the whole safety video and pre take off information, but we hadn't left the gate yet. Look outside, it's pouring, thunder, lighting, hail. It didn't look good. After about 40 minutes of no information, I got sick and tired of it, so I confronted the cabin crew to make some announcements, which they did eventually, in Spanish. Remember, this was a Vancouver bound flight, most people spoke English. After about three hours of little information, little water and no food, they cancelled the flight and deplanned due to bad weather and a fuel related issue. We all thought, well great, at least we will get a hotel. Just getting our exit tickets took about an hour because there were only two gate attendents trying to help over 200 angry passengers. To make matters worse, they said they wouldn't rebook us and we'd have to figure it out ourselves. They gave us a local number to call, only problem, we didn't have local cell phones. Sick and tired of the gate attendents only speaking Spanish, we went to the check in counters to try and rebook, only to find a giant queue of confused passengers. Turns out, the airport cancelled all their flights that night. So we stood in the line and about an hour and a half later, we got our new tickets for a flight in 2 days. To make matters worse we still had to collect our check in bags and find a hotel. 3hrs later, we got our bags and went to Aeromexico to find a hotel, only to learn that they will not be compensating is because the delay was weather related. Mind you, the captain told us the delay and cancellation was due to the fuel misshap. No matter what we said to their ""customer service representative"" they wouldn't budge. We were forced to spend two days in the airport with our bags and fellow passengers who also got screwed by Aeromexico because by the time we finished this while rebooking thing, all the hotels were sold out by other airlines.

I was shocked by the horrible, unprofessional, incompetent way that I was treated by Aeromexico during my recent flight. Their deception, misinformation and incompetence cost me 8,612 extra pesos! I should not have been treated this way. I arrived at the Mexico City airport in the early morning, hours before my flight. I checked in at Aeromexico's check-in desk. The clerk checked my printed ticket and my U.S. passport and confirmed them. I asked if there was anything else, and she said no, that I was good to go. She checked in my suitcase and gave me the receipt for my checked-in bag. Then I went to my gate and waited several hours until boarding. When boarding began, I stood in line and eventually reached the front of the line, expecting to be checked in and board the plane. The Aeromexico employee at the gate asked me for the stub from my Mexican immigration papers, which I signed upon entering the country. The Aeromexico clerk at the baggage check-in had said nothing about this stub when I asked if there was ""anything else"" I needed. When she indicated that there wasn't, I placed the stub into my suitcase, which she then checked in. The clerk at the gate told me not to worry, that all I'd need to do is go to the Immigration desk and sign another immigration stub. She told me to sign it, then come back to the gate — that I could then board at the gate with no problem. That turned out to be a lie — or at least, radical misinformation. At her direction, I ran to the Immigration desk, signed a second immigration stub, and paid a 500 peso penalty, then sprinted back to the gate, returning just minutes after I had left. Suddenly the clerk at the gate had completely changed her tune. ""Sorry,"" she said, ""plane's leaving. You can't board."" I reminded her that she told me to go get the second immigration stub, return to the gate, and that I'd have no problem boarding the plane. The clerk brushed off my concern like it was of no importance and returned to chatting with a fellow employee. Upset, I went to the Aeromexico customer service desk. The clerk there told me not to worry, that this was no problem at all. ""There's a 9:05 am.flight to JFK,"" she said. ""Just go to the Aeromexico desk at L2 or L3, ask for the manager and have her switch you to that flight. It will be no charge.""  But this turned out to be a lie too. I should have known something was up because the clerk refused to tell me her name.  When I sighed, she told me again: Just go to L2 or L3, talk to the manager, and get the free reassignment. ""It's just a little bit of paperwork,"" she said. So I went to L2 and waited in line for 45 minutes to see the manager. When I got to the front desk, the clerk there said that if I wanted to get on the next flight, there would be a penalty - a 8,112 pesos. That's $453.65. ""It's Aeromexico procedure,"" they said. In the end, I spoke with 8 Aeromexico employees, but none helped, including the customer service help line. They told me they had no power to process customer service matters.",Aeromexico,,,

The lack of customer service is why I will never fly them again. We had originally booked our trip on March 2, 2017 and picked our dates and flights based on the family budget for our vacation. In May we received notice that the return flight was cancelled and come to find out there were no flights with them back at anytime that day. So we could either fly back with someone else and we could stay another day. After looking over the options the cheapest was to stay another day. I understand that this can happen, but with any other airlines they would try to compensate the customer because of the issues. After trying to contact them, found out that in order to get an answer the only option was through email with a 5 day response time. As a group we were just hoping that they might at least pay for our baggage since it would not cost the airlines extra money and it would help us by paying some of the cost we were having to pay out. By the time they finally answered it was to say no, but that they were sorry and really hoped to get our business back. We have flown with other airlines and they moved our flight by 15 minutes and gave use $25 vouchers that could be used for future flights or our baggage. So even with all of this we went and when checking back in, the website would not allow us to add baggage to 4 of our guest as it showed they already had paid baggage, so we add the 2 extra. However, when we got to the airport, it only showed the 2 bags. So now instead of the $20 we have to pay $25. However, when we went to pay because of the currency exchange we had to pay $30 and they were not willing to honor the $20 we would have paid because of their website issues.

Pillow ok (a bit small) and nice comforter. The video screen was large and the IFE selection was excellent. Food was disappointing - bland and overcooked. Wine and champagne selection was good. International airport lounge in Mexico City closed early at 10pm and they had us move to a very crowded domestic lounge farther away from the gates. The second lounge was dirty, wines were not re-stocked and food was sparse. It was a mess. The cabin staff was the rudest I have ever experienced in business class on any airline. Bare minimum. Rarely came through the cabin. I was not served at dinner, asked for a meal and a drink after waiting over an hour and was treated very rudely. It is a pity that this airline, which has obviously invested heavily in nice equipment, has such lousy service staff - both on the ground and in the air. They need to fix it.

I have been a long time customer of AeroMexico, and overall, I am happy to recommend AeroMexico. All of their planes lean to new or recently renovated, their fares are competitive, and their service is competent. On this trip I was flying JFK-MEX-ACA. The MEX ACA route is an E190, and basically so short (45 minutes) that it is not worth reviewing. Only comment I have there is that I am not a huge fan of gate-bus-gangway flights that Aeromexico opts for for its E190s, as a result of having more planes than Terminal 2 at CdMx can handle. The flight from JFK was great, with only a few hiccups. Checking in at a Premier Clase desk is usually a speedy affair, though this time they could not give me a connecting boarding pass for the Acapulco leg until I got to the gate - they said that check in was not open for that flight - something that has never happened to me on this route before (with identical itinerary). Boarding was easy enough - though I would advise travellers to find and line up in their zone early - there tends to be a rush, and overhead space is always at a premium owing to the seemingly lax enforcement to carry-on rules. It always seems that the ""personal"" bag is the same size as the carry on. The staff was polite, and the announcements clear (and they did get my connecting boarding pass printed). So now on to the Boeing 787 and Clase Premiere, I love this plane. By far the best I have flown. The configurations differ; this was 1-2-1 pods, with little storage bins, lie flat seats and a movable outer armrest (also with storage). The entertainment screen is big, can be accessed by touch screen or by small tethered controller hidden away. There is ample space, both width and length. The seats are comfortable, and the plane feels spacious. There are three bathrooms for business class, two of which feel spacious (they have windows). The inflight service is courteous, but overall can feel absent at times. They serve a beverage before takeoff (water, juice, champagne), a pre-dinner drink/cheese plate, dinner (basic meat/pasta options, salad, roll & dessert) and that's it. Immigration and custom forms are distributed while you are still at the gate, which I like. Previously it seemed like they never handed them out until the last moment. There is a back galley with self service items for later on in the flight, including an attendant who insists on carrying open liquids (coffee, etc) for you to your seat. There was advertisements for Wifi, and the Wifi light was on during the flight, but was never available, either on the US side of the border or the Mexican side. That was a disappointment. Its a no brainer to opt for this plane over the 737 when your schedule allows. This plane makes one trip a day MEX-JFK in the morning, and JFK-MEX in the afternoon. The rest of the Aeromexico planes on this route are 737-8/9. Good planes, same service, but the 787 is in a different league.",Aeromexico,Boeing 787,5,1

We flew from Toronto to Guatemala City, with a layover in Mexico City. One thing I will say is that these flights never leave on time. I think every single one of our flights were late. But, we still managed to arrive at our destinations within 10-20 minutes of the original arrival time (sometimes earlier). Though, I think it would be ideal to keep in mind that if you have to make a layover, try and plan for at least a 1-2 hour layover. This will give you some wiggle room with an airline that is notorious for delays and save you the headache and stress. The food was mediocre, but I find most airplane food is. I have flown several times internationally to Asia, and have never liked the food. On our flights it was a croissant sandwich and a snack - standard and nothing wrong with it. I didn't have any negative experiences with the flight attendants on these flights. No one was rude or unhelpful. Seats were as comfortable as I expected them to be. A few of our flight segments were overbooked, which seems to be general practice for most airlines, which is what seemed to lead to the delays we were experiencing.

I will say the cabin crew and the flight itself was actually pretty good. My review is regarding the airline's ground crew and counter staff at Benito Juarez International in Mexico City. We were travelling from Havana, Cuba to Vancouver, Canada, transiting through Mexico City. Flyers are unable to do online check-in when flying from Havana. The airline simply does not allow this. So this meant getting to the Havana airport super early for our 6am flight. We were checked in all the way to Vancouver, but were only given the boarding pass to Mexico City. We were told to collect our boarding passes upon landing. The flight from Havana to Mexico City was fine. Landing at Benito Juarez International, upon clearing customs, we were greeted by Aeromexico staff who had pre-printed boarding passes for multiple flights. It was a bit odd because they were standing in the open with literally hundreds of boarding passes piled in front of them, and they were positioned between the exit doors and the bathrooms. They didn't find our boarding passes and we were instructed to go to the kiosks. The boarding passes wouldn't print from the kiosks. We were told this was because we'd already been checked in and the boarding passes had already been issued? So we were then directed to line up for a counter agent. When we reached the counter agent, we were told to go to another line up, for another counter. This counter was specifically for ""issues with kiosks printing boarding passes""! There were three counters and two agents working, but only one agent appeared to be working at any given time, as they would periodically disappear. After reaching this final agent, we were able to get our ""pre-issued"", ""pre-printed"" boarding passes. This process took nearly 90 minutes from the time we entered the terminal. It's the first time I've experienced something like this but judging from the comments, it's not uncommon. The flights themselves were fine. The attendants were efficient and the food was acceptable. The seats were decent, as was the onboard entertainment system. The flight from Mexico City to Vancouver had USB ports to charge devices while inflight. I really appreciated that.

The night before the flight I was informed that my first name had been miss spelled by the travel agent who had assisted with booking my flights. I was informed by Aeromexico customer service that it was at the check in representatives discretion whether or not I would be able to fly on each of my flights with a misspelled name. They were not willing to change my name to my correct name and the flight would be non-refundable so if the Airline attendant refused to allow me to fly I would not be able to go on my Honeymoon nor would they be willing to refund my flights. Luckily my connecting flight was with Avianca not Aeromexico and Avianca was able to fix my name on each of their flights. I ended up going back and forth with 14 different customer services representatives with Aeromexico for about 4 ½ hours the night before my trip. Each customer services representative was excuses orientated rather than solution orientated and gave me one excuses after another about why they could not do something as simple as correcting my name. I continued to hang up on each representative after multiple excuses and would call back in. One representative tried to ask for $150.00 fee for each flight to fix my name so it was spelt correctly, this is when I knew that Aeromexico is all about making the travel experience as frustrating as possible for its customers so that it can get more money out of them. I refused to pay the fees and continued to call back in, I was finally able to speak with someone who somehow fixed my name on my flight home and informed me I would need to take my chances on the way there so I went to the Tijuana airport, did my best to distract the Airline attendant, and was able to get through without them catching my first name was miss-spelt as Jospeh rather than the correct spelling Joseph.

Some snacks were provided at the back of the plane, however there was no information about this until you discovered them.

This took two additional hours of a 12 hours flight! Also, the maintenance of one of the restroom was not good, as one of the toilet's lid couldn't stand on the tank, so for women we had to use it with the toilet lid standing on our back.

After you got your pass, you are now randomized into one of the three queues to drop your luggage and get your documents revised. The whole process is a mess, with people not understanding where to go. The red jacket personnel act more like grade school teachers than airport personnel asking clients to get in line. The queuing takes about 20 minutes. Boarding was done by zones, but since we had other flights boarding around, we were quite confused. On board, the airplane is spotless. Cabin crew works hard and is friendly, but a bit aloof. They were neatly dressed and groomed. Seats were the usual economy seats.

Booked a flight for a vacation to Cancun from SFO departing on 4/29, 11pm. The flight had a layover in Mexico City, then arrive in Cancun 10am 4/30. Needless to say, that didn't happen. Our flight was delayed 45 min, boarded the plane and sat in the plane for another 45min, only to be informed to disembark due to an issue with the plane's cargo door. The time was 12:30-1:00am. We're told that they would inform us every 20min what was happening. We had to inquire ourselves. After another 2hrs, (3:15am), we're informed that our flight was cancelled and we needed retrieve our luggage and await for instructions. All 128 or so passengers waited for the luggage another 45min! (Understanding that at this point, there is only a skeleton crew working at the airport!) Once everyone retrieved luggage, we're told to go to the Aeromexico ticket counter so everyone could be assigned new tickets. We all stood in line for more than an hr without a single movement of the line because there are only 3 windows with three staff members working to help every single passenger! After 1 hour, we hear a person shout out, ""Anyone going to Cancun, please head to the Delta ticket counter and they would assist us there"". So everyone going on to Cancun are running to the Delta ticket counter with all of our luggage. We had been at the airport for more than 11hrs now. Once at the Delta ticket counter, got in line (now there are people in line checking in for Delta flights) so the line is long. My husband asks one of the Delta agents and they told us we're in the wrong line and needed to move to the ""special services"" line. So again, moved to this line and waited another 45min before getting to the counter. There was a Delta flight going to Cancun at 7:00am but by this time, too late for this flight. The person assisting us did not know what was going on at all!  They booked us on the next flight to Cancun which departed at 8:00am. While we were at the ticket counter, another person who was also being helped, requested a direct flight to Cancun, which they accommodated and it was not even a Delta flight, it was thru United. When we asked if we could do the same, the person told us that he could do this. The tickets he assigned us was all that we could get. We realize what had happened to us was not his fault but he could have assisted us as much as possible.  We get to Cancun at 6:30pm and lost a day of our vacation. No apologies, no vouchers, no refunds. The day before we leave Cancun, we try to checkin and it prompts us that we need to contact Aeromexico. Called and we're informed we have to check in at the airport. Get to the airport 2.5hrs early, flight departs at 2pm, get to the counter only to be told, they can not find our etickets in the system.

I spent the following two weeks requesting a written statement of this and finally received it by email. Three months later, I still have not received my reimbursement and have been paying interest on this large amount.

I told him that all of the spaces were taken and he again made a noise and asked for my ticket I handed him the ticket and after taking it he just walked away, I followed him as he approached my seat and after checking all the compartments he grunted and again walked away I stood there for a while with my bag on my seat, after a few minutes I saw him again and asked for the space and he said there wasn't any, -for the shape of my bag it was a bit difficult for me to put it underneath my seat- so I asked if he could check again, he again walked away but this time I followed him, he noticed and started forcefully opening all the compartments in the way, he saw one in the business class section and looked me up and down before making a sign that there was space - I got closer and said thanks, he just grunted in response, as I said earlier I'm a short person, so putting the bag in was a bit of a challenge, he just stood there while I struggled to fit my bag, it wasn't until another passenger from the business class got up and helped me that I managed to get the bag in, the flight attendant then proceeded to forcefully shut the compartment and walk away. I'm Asian/Latino so I speak Spanish fluently but during the rest of the flight he pretended that he couldn't understand anything I said.

Aeroméxico has made so many of its' clients ""special"" Platinum/SkyPriority clients that essentially nobody is anymore. The Platinum line when checking in is often just as long if not longer than the line for non-privileged passengers. They need to control who gets to go into the SkyPriority/Platinum line with a little more discretion since little incentive exists to spend your travel budget on the same airline. This flight had no personal entertainment systems although my flight from Mexico City to San Francisco did have a personal entertainment system in the coach cabin. This plane was a much older aircraft in everything including seat comfort and ergonomics. Food has gotten progressively worse even in the first-class cabin over the last couple of years. They used to be a little more creative in first-class and serve decent wine. The food on my last six flights of which five have been in the first-class cabin has been mediocre at best. My real problem with Aeroméxico and the reason I am giving them a rating of 1 out of 10 is that on two of my last three trips they have lost my luggage. Both times I was flying in the first-class cabin and had those ""priority luggage"" tags affixed to each suitcase. I have never once seen ""priority luggage"" come out first either when I land in the USA or in Mexico. I think Aeroméxico should just do away with them because they have absolutely zero utility. Aeroméxico has the worst system for handling lost luggage. They just lie to you and don't answer either phone calls or emails even though the little paper they give you promises that they will respond in three hours to email. The lost luggage group never picks up the phone and when you are by some miracle somehow able to get a hold of someone the only thing they are capable of doing is giving you some kind of false apology.  Part of the problem is that Aeroméxico is not penalized in any way for not delivering lost luggage in a timely manner. They don't compensate passengers even if that passenger doesn't get their luggage in three or four days. They could care less about what you have trapped in the lost luggage and are unable to give you an estimated date or time when you will actually have your luggage. They are even incapable of simply saying if your luggage was found at the airport of origin. The worst part is that they don't care.

We waited for our next flight to get going, but when I was boarding the flight attendent ask me for the immigration piece of paper that was given back to my husband but not to me. No one said that I needed one also, so we assumed it was a family trip immigration paper. Well, the flight attendant was very rude, could speak hardly any English and just told me I could not leave the country of Mexico without it. She told us to go find someone who could speak English. Well, as you can imagine, everyone else is boarding and we are rushing around trying to find an English speaking person. It was just hell! We finally did find another tourist who had the same problem, he directed us to a very angry man who said we had to fill out another immigration card and give him $20.00 U.S. Before I could leave the country. Well this took about an hour. By this time, our dream first class flight to Costa Rica had gone and so had our money which we had paid for it. We went immediately to Aeromexico customer service desk, hoping we could get on the next available flight - they were able to put us on a flight at 8:30 am the next morning but we were charged $1135.00US for 2 people in economy. We tried to explain the situation and circumstances which happened that were beyond our control. But still, we had to pay the amount or we weren't going. No empathy, no trying to help us at all. It was if you want to go you pay what they say. It was the most terrifying trip, landing there in Mexico and then being told you could not leave because you did not have a piece of paper which I was not given back, just my husband was.

So I could pay for it or I had to wait to be in the flight date at the airline desk in order to ask for it. When I did it, the person at the desk (Durango airport) told me that she had not available seats so anyway I requested her to put me in the waiting list. I was the 3rd passenger that arrived at the airport for that flight (Durango has a small airport and the second passenger is my friend and he didn't requested an upgrade) - she answered yes no problem I will remember you because I will be at the gate collecting the boarding passes. At the boarding time I could see that the lady called anther person that arrived later than me (about three or four persons) and she gave them upgrades - I don't know why she didn't gave it to me even if I arrived before than them.  I think you should allow to get an upgrade to any platinum level that calls 72 hours to get an upgrade because we are into the period of time requested by Aeromexico, obviously if there are free seats.

With every other global airline, requesting a special meal isnt a problem but with Aeromexico, on shorter flights its even worse. There is a ham and cheese sandwich or nothing!

The outward leg was utter chaos. My son was scheduled to fly on the Oaxaca - Mexico City section of the journey to connect with a BA flight. I had booked him on the 7 pm flight as offered on Orbitz, to leave with BA at 9.45 pm (more or less). I was told by Aeromexico staff that this was extremely unwise - because of delays on their own airline - and to change his ticket to 3 pm which I duly did, at a cost of about 1000 pesos. We arrived for this flight only to be told it was cancelled and that he had to fly on the 7 pm flight. I had to buy him a ticket on a different airline to be able to get to his BA flight. I then returned to our 7 pm flight with my daughters only to discover I no longer had a seat on the Mexico City to London flight and that we were no longer seated together (I had selected our seats a long time before). I was luckily given a seat and then able to change places with a kindly passenger (the airline staff were no help) to be with my daughters. Why had my seat been taken away? Overselling the flight. At check-in at Mexico City there were a lot of passengers who had a ticket but suddenly no assigned seat and were on standby. Families lost booked vacations because one parent was suddenly not on the flight and the next available opportunity? Try again on Wednesday. People screamed because meetings had been made and would not be reached. It was, in a word, chaos. Once on the plane, we discovered that although it was supposed to be the new plane, the seats were incredibly close together (not so on the return leg) and the journey was uncomfortable to say the least, and I'm not tall. My vegetarian meal somehow transmutated into kosher and I couldn't eat it, as it contained meat. I was offered no alternative. The return flight filled me with dread, but was actually OK. We had an easy-check in and boarding, the plane was a lot more comfortable and my vegetarian meal appeared.

The problem is that they are hit or miss, and this time is was a great miss. Only one person checking a whole flight in, other counters were open for the rest of Aeromexico red eyes, yet flights to Canada back then had to be checked in by ""specially trained people"" (whatever that means) - which today consisted of only one lady who looked overwhelmed. There was no online check in for this flight for the same reasons cited above. On other occasions on the same flight, Aeromexico had at least three agents, and Air Canada has 4 agents checking in two canada-bound flights. There was no priority check-in for those traveling in Clase Premier. Once I got my boarding pass, I went to look for a floor manager so that he could bring other agents to assist this poor lady, I do not know if it worked. Security went swiftly, personnel at MEX tend to be very friendly. Terminal 2 is way better than terminal 1 in that it feels more spacious and smells less bad. The Premier lounge was OK. It has a modern decor which might look a bit cold . It was quite crowded given the high number of Aeromexico's late night departures (YUL, CDG, NRT, UIO, JFK, ORD etc). Boarding happened in a very organized way, but upon boarding, I realized that as opposed to my previous experiences on this route, this plane was not the newer ones. The male purser was standing at the entrance greeting everyone as if it was a hassle. Seats were in terrible condition and the plane was not particularly clean. Entertainment system consisted of drop down screens that had a terrible resolution, and earphones worked partially. Even in Clase Premier, legroom was appalling. The purser was a bit unfriendly, but the other flight attendant, who kept coming back and forth from the main cabin was outstanding. Once airborne, we were given snacks, and except from the aforementioned flight attendant who I kept seeing over and over again, the rest of the crew proceeded to get paid for sitting down in the jump-seat. Food was served one hour before the estimated arrival time, and its quality was borderline. We were put on holding pattern for nearly one hour but there was no information about this from the flight crew, maybe they thought that nobody would notice. Deplaning went swiftly, but after crossing the air bridge, the glass doors towards the terminal were locked and we had to wait some time for Aeromexico ground staff to come and open it (I suppose it is best to open it before passengers actually deplane). Overall a pretty mediocre-bad experience, it is a shame to receive the same type of service you would receive on a MEX-CUN flight on the largest North American route of the company, and for it to be delivered with such carelessness. Consistency is key in customer service, and it hurts me to see how Aeromexico proudly parades this flaw both in terms of hard and soft products.

Smooth ride, nice landing, made it to Mexico City, from there we took a bigger plane but a little bit older, still a smooth ride and landing.

The toilet at the back of the plane smelt disgusting. I asked a flight attendant if they at least had some kind of spray to alleviate the stench and she grudgingly produced something and stuck her hand around the door and squirted. I have flown several times on this airline recently and the thing that leaves a lasting impression is the complete lack of interest shown by the cabin crew in their jobs.

I thought that having bought my ticket so cheaply and being in the lowest cabin class, the flying experience would not be very good, but I was surprised by the kind attention of the stewardesses and also by a tasty breakfast in the morning.

I booked a flight in February for a trip May 21-25 from DFW to PVR. Received an email from my booking site (Rovia) giving me details. From that point to the time of the trip I constantly checked Aeromexico's website for the flight info and it told me that I can't check it until 24 hours before the flight is set to depart. I check it when that time comes and the flight has been rescheduled and conflicted with my connecting flight in Mexico City (both Arrival and departure). This was done without any email notice or anything. There was no attempt to fix the mess up with the exception of giving me a flight in days later and flight out many more days after my trip. This was to be my first trip out of the country and this airline ruined it so I am completely unsatisfied and will definitely recommend anyone doing business with Aeromexico.,Aeromexico,,,

The MID-MEX leg was operated by an E190 no IFE and the snacks were average peanuts but the seats were comfortable and due to the length of the flight it wasn't important. The second leg was on a 737-700. The seats were comfortable and very nice blankets were provided however the IFE was quite limited (overhead screens that played movies and nothing else and were shut off 3 quarters into the flight) so I would recommend bringing your own entertainment if you're flying an Aeromexico 737.

The only positive comment about the experience is that Aeromexico allows access to the Air France lounge at SFO. Everything else about the flight was a complete disappointment. Check in at SFO was slow and disorganized. Equipment looked very tired not well maintained and dirty. IFE was an antique. Old school seats with minimal space. Worst part of the flight was the service provided by the FA. She barely spoke to passengers during the 3.5 hour flight. There was only one beverage service no nuts no peanuts nothing served with drink. Lunch including dessert came on one tray served from a dirty looking trolley. Aeromexico catering is a complete joke. Tiny salads of tough lettuce leaves cooked to death chicken cutlet that was like the sole of a shoe dried up carrots an insipid soggy little tartlet with Cool Whip. After lunch the galley curtains were drawn and the FA disappeared for 2+ hours until landing. Not one pass through the cabin to offer of a drink water nothing. Aeromexico should be ashamed of themselves for treating their Business Class passengers this way.,Aeromexico,,1,

Food service on this flight was much better than on my previous flights with Aeromexico in Clase Premier. Cabin crew were excellent and very professional. The purser knew each of the business class passenger's last names (there were 16 of us) and she was always around to see if she was needed. I fell asleep and she left me a drink and peanuts for when I woke up. Aeromexico staff is usually just OK - they are efficient but are cold and tend to disappear into the galley afterwards. This was not the case in this flight when there was always a flight attendant in the cabin (even in economy class). Great flight overall wish all crews performed this way.,Aeromexico,,5,

Our outbound SFO to MEX was great on a 737-800 with footrests and plenty of room. The return tonight was awful. The legroom on business class required my wife to climb over the center console to get out of her seat. The flight attendant came by to offer a drink and slapped down my chicken dinner which was cold. He never returned for two hours to refill my water. They kept the galley curtain closed and he sat and was playing a video game most of the flight. I such a shame when you are a full fare business class customer. Airlines should be required to uphold a certain standard and inform the passengers.,Aeromexico,,1,

They have multiple direct flights. I have been happy with their service both at the counter at the gate and on the airplane. The planes seem to be maintained well and bathrooms and seating areas are clean. Service is pleasant and professional without trying to be cute during announcements. The food to me just seems to be a little better the service a bit more professional and the areas cleaner than everyone else. Again much of what one views is based on perceptions and a few negative things can color one's view. In my case I see so many small positive things that it has probably colored my view of Aeromexico in a good way.,Aeromexico,,5,

The boarding and departure were timeous. The service onboard for the quick domestic flight to Oaxaca was super friendly and cheerful. I cannot fault this airline.

The flight schedules are convenient and the staff I have encountered have been friendly and helpful when I have needed them. Only once have I had a issue due to weather - and they made sure to get me on another flight and while my bags did not make it on the plane they had them secured and waiting for me the next morning.

Both were on time check in went quickly and smoothly every Aeromexico person I had contact with was professional and friendly and even boarding was quick and efficient. The meals - sandwich and candy bar - was well a sandwich but the bread was fresh and a fun sized Snickers isn't all that bad. This was my second and third flight with Aeromexico and all were very pleasant flights. I caught up on a TV show going down and a movie coming back home.

My next leg was MEX to TIJ in a B737-700 old cramped no inflight entertainment just one tiny bag of peanuts for a 3 hour flight toilet old and dirty. The boarding procedure AM is implementing is awful and useless. It takes longer and it is absurd. First they board pax on window seats then center seats and on final call aisle seats no matter if you are in row 10 or 24. Uncomfortable at the gates. AM is the best airline there is in Mexico.,Aeromexico,,1,

One day before departure I received an e-mail informing me that the return flight was postponed from October 14th at 23:15 to October 15th at 08:40. Since I had to be back in Sao Paulo on the 15th in the afternoon I contacted Aeromexico in Brazil to request that my return flight be transferred to TAM who code share with Aeromexico on this segment with the flight leaving Mexico City around 20.00. Aeromexico told me that the notification must be a mistake because they see no changes in their system and all flights are according to original reservation. As proof they even sent me a copy of electronic ticket which really showed all the correct departure times. Also checking the Aeromexico site there was no indication of any delay. So I forgot all about it until one day before my return flight when I got a Trip Reminder e-mail stating again that the return flight was now at 08:40 on the 15th instead of 23:15 of the 14th. I again contacted Aeromexico this time in Mexico and again they confirmed that everything was according to original reservations and they had no information about any delay. After using Aeromexico's online check-in system and receiving electronic boarding passes with the correct time stamped on them I felt somehow reassured. My mistake. When I arrived at the airport to check-in my luggage I was informed that due to ""unscheduled maintenance"" the flight would be delayed by 10 hours. Unscheduled Maintenance? Really? Either Aeromexico's computer system is totally screwed up and they have no idea of what is happening with their schedules or they simply are lying to their passengers to avoid having to transfer tickets to other airlines. Whatever it is it is totally unacceptable!",Aeromexico,,3,

The Madrid flight was in a 777 and the London - Mexico flight was in a new 787. Completely different experience. They have substantially improved their food offering but now the crews have an excellent attitude in the way they treat the clients. The seat in the 777 is outdated as is the entertainment system but the 787 flat bed seat is a great quality seat.

I had three tickets to Mexico from two different places. On all three tickets and on two separate occasions they changed the flights and added a ten hour layover. They said that they would fix it by asking me to leave a day later. I booked through Expedia and they would not help. I was on the phone with Expedia and Aeromexico for at least two hours. They did offer a refund but by this time all the fares were at least $250 more. I had to cancel all three tickets and rebuy on other airlines at an extra cost of $750!

Both flights were on the newer 737-800s. I was upgraded on the outbound flight. Seats were the standard for medium haul although getting off the seat to walk can be cumbersome for those on the window seats. Meals were OK. Purser was courteous but distant. Inbound flight is a redeye. Service and meals were really good seats new and comfortable the one problem is that Montreal flights have a dedicated check in area and there were only two staff members working the flight so it took a while to check in. New 737s are really modern with PTVs and sky interiors. I don't know if this experience is enough to say that they have really improved.,Aeromexico,,5,

The crew was young and attentive professional and bilingual. The aircraft was a wonderfully well kept 737-800 with a state of the art entertainment system. Complementary snacks and drinks including alcohol were served twice during the journey. Landing was on time and arrival at the gate was relatively quick.

The cabin itself is nothing out of the ordinary for business class. It is a 2-2-2 configuration typical on 787s. Enough room to stretch out and sleep if needed. What disappointed me though was the service. You would expect for paying what I paid for that seat they would have been more attentive. The only times the flight attendants came around to attend to us was when serving dinner serving breakfast and once to bring us a bottle of water. Other than that they stayed in their areas chatting the entire flight. I was traveling with a family member and we stood up to stretch and order a beer. Well after they had served us each two they said they were out of beers. Really? Overall the only thing this flight had going for it is that it is the Dreamliner and it is direct from NRT to MEX. if you don't mind a stopover I recommend flying to SAN on JAL's Dreamliner and transferring there or maybe to LAX on SQ's 380 and transferring there. Aeromexico needs to step up its service game if it hopes to compete with the Asian carriers.,Aeromexico,,2,

Boarding at LAX was a bit of a mess because AeroMexico boards every window seat first then every middle seat aisle seat etc. Airplane was clean and my AM Plus seat had a few more inches of extra leg room. Take-off was smooth and the flight was good. A few hours into the flight breakfast and coffee were served. I did not partake because I was asleep (a special thank you to the flight attendant for not waking me up). Flight attendants were courteous respectful and polite. We arrived in MEX about 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Several days later I flew MEX to LAX (AM648) on a brand new 737-800. Once again sat on AM Plus row #7. Beautiful brand new leather seats with a personal TV screens. Every AM Plus seat was tastefully decorated with pillows blankets and headphones.

However received an email telling me of the 2 hour delay and my flight back to NY was cancelled. Called the airline and was told the cancellation was a mistake. When time to fly back to NY as scheduled I show up a the airport to be told my flight was cancelled! They could only offer me to fly out by 1am from Mx City to NY or rebook my flight for the next day. Booked the flight for following day and again my flight from GDL to MX City was delayed which made me lose my flight from MX City to NY and had to wait 9 hours until 1am to take the next flight back to NY from MX City. Plus Mx City Airport need to increase their WiFi Service. I was stuck for 9 hours totally bored with no WiFi good service. I was so disappointed because I had liked AeroMexico before and never had problems but this time I noticed their great service has declined. The only thing I thank them for is the food vouchers I got to get free food from any vendor at the airport.

Our original tickets were for placement on a larger airplane. We boarded the plane. We waited on the runway for almost 2 hours. Every time someone needed to use the restroom they were told to sit down. Nothing was offered during this time. Finally the captain came on and said we had to return to the gate. He said we couldn't take off because of a maintenance issue. We got off the plane got our luggage and were told were told to go to the ticket counter. At the ticket counter we waited for another 2 hours. We asked if staff could at least provide some water and they said no they didn't have any. Unacceptable. We waited another hour until we were finally given a new connecting flight some food vouchers and a hotel room that we napped in for only 2 hours before we had to be back for the morning flight. I do not recommend flying with them.,Aeromexico,,4,

When we were checking in the agent told us that the flight was delayed 50 minutes. We passed security and went to the business lounge until 1.45am - the time we were told to board. We made it to our seats only to wait 5 minutes and they told us there would be a delay of 3 hours so we didn't board until 4.30am. We went to our seats 1A and 1B. The width of the seats was uncomfortable but they do recline almost 180°. Service was awful. They only served the food no drinks offered and food was either salad or chicken. No AVOD and even not a movie during the 6 hour flight the TV was shared. We arrived delayed in Mexico City. Overall I do not recommend business class it is not worth the price.,Aeromexico,,1,

Staff were friendly and helpful. We encountered no problems with this airline. Our flights ran on schedule and our luggage was not lost. On the return trip I was missing a form at the time of boarding staff quickly helped me fill it out and held the plane for me to run back to the boarding gate. We will use this airline again.

They were taken to a game room that was a restricted area for unaccompanied minors only where they were supervised and played video games and watched movies. My children said everyone they encountered with AeroMexico were helpful and friendly. No problems at all with delays baggage etc... I will use this airline again.

Aeromexico screwed up the connection so I missed my leg to LAX. Instead of simply rebooking me on a later flight (of which there were three) they wanted to reticket me and charge me the then rate which was $650 more than I had originally paid. Seriously? You want me to pay $650 for your mistake. Worse when I said I'd fly Alaska instead they didn't care - but refused to refund me my original money for the MEX to LAX leg. This is the second such instance with this airline. Two years ago I was making the same trip and also was not able to complete the leg from MEX to LAX. They said there was ""weather problems"" in LA. (My family was at the airport in LA at the time and said it was clear as day and gorgeous weather). So they cancelled my flight to LAX and I was told I couldn't get on another flight until the next day. They made me pay for my hotel room at the Mexico City airport because it was a weather delay (which it wasn't) and was beyond their control. Worse I had purchased an upgrade to First Class earlier in the day (before the flight was cancelled) and when the First Class cabin was not available on the flight the next day they wouldn't refund my First Class upgrade cost even though they were going to put me in Coach. So when I got home I filed suit in Small Claims Court and I won the cost of the hotel and the First Class upgrade cost.",Aeromexico,,3,

EMB190 and B737-800 were new and great B737-700 was old but well kept. First row on economy is great with plenty of leg room. All flights were on time and service was good. They offer only refreshments and alcoholic drinks. Attendants were nice and speak English perfectly. Terminal 2 at MEX is modern and great. Luggage drop and security was very fast. On B737-700 and -800 there was full IFE service with more than 10 movies.,Aeromexico,,5,

Plane is an oldish 737 without personal IFE but it was just fine in both legs. Seat Ok and amenity kit that Aeromexico now handles only on overnight flight with some space for improvement even though it was delivered with a really nice IPAD case. As far as service is concerned a huge difference between the MEX-LIM and the LIM-MEX leg. On the first leg it was outstanding with a professional warm and polite flight attendant. Good food and good selection of drinks. On the way back flights attendants did not even bother to greet passengers and performed their job mechanically and without interest. What a difference! What a lack of consistency in the product delivered by Aeromexico. A 3/10 would be a perfect grade to describe this last experience.,Aeromexico,,3,

We were told there was haze over LA and we needed to land in Tijuana Mexico to re-fuel and allow it to clear up. After sitting in the plane at Tijuana for 1 hr they told us the plane was no longer going to fly to LA so we could get off and figure things on our own or fly back to Guadalajara and be on standby for flights back. We were supposed to arrive in LA at 9.45 it is now close to midnight and we're stuck in TJ. The flight attendants did not try to accommodate us while waiting. They sat in the back on their phones. We waiting for at least 45 min before we were allowed off the plane then waited an additional hour for our luggage. At the airport there was no help and no assistance. We actually had to have family drive 4 hours to pick us up and I have 2 small children with me.,Aeromexico,,,

JFK-MEX on the red eye was completed on an older model 737 with no inflight entertainment (presumably due to the timing of the flight - depart 12.15am arrive 4.40am) but we were served a very nice hot sandwich shortly after takeoff. MEX-JFK return on a brand-new 737 - great plane excellent inflight entertainment and again a nice hot meal. The ZIH-MEX connection was slightly delayed but we were assured that a significant amount of passengers on the flight were connecting to the JFK flight. Sure enough about 18 of us were greeted by an agent upon deplaning in MEX and were escorted as a group to the JFK gate which was in the process of boarding. Excellent service throughout by both ground and cabin crews. Would not hesitate to recommend Aeromexico in the future.,Aeromexico,,4,

My only complaints are: 1) They forgot my vegetarian meal on LIM-MEX leg. The flight attendant brushed me off and just left without even asking if I wanted a drink or a regular meal. Never bothered to check and never came back. 2) They sold me a flight that had a 1.5 hours layover in Mexico City I wasn't aware of the whole customs-immigration-checking my bags again at MEX airport. If they know of this whole ordeal why would they sell flights with such short layovers? Food and service: Most staff were pleasant. The food was pretty decent and free drinks even alcoholic ones. The flight didn't have individual screens so there's only one movie option. They did have radio and gave headphones a pillow and a blanket. Overall it wasn't a bad experience. As a side note if you have a connection through Mexico airport and are pressed for time make sure you ask the personnel if you can't find something as its lacking some signs. The conveyor belt for my flight was in a separate room than most of the belts had I not asked someone I probably would've waited in vain.,Aeromexico,,2,

I have never travelled on an airline that would weigh my carry on luggage or personal purse. The customer service reps at the airport in Mexico City were rude.

Thought I'd found a good value on a business class ticket that would let me earn skymiles. Wrong! I flew in business both ways but only got skymiles one direction because of the ""class of service"". (The leg where I got stuck in the middle seat is the one I earned miles on.) ""Middle seat in business class"" you might be saying? Why yes. Not the seat I reserved when I booked but the seating chart at that time didn't even show a middle seat. Would not recommend don't plan to fly again myself.",Aeromexico,,,

The inflight service was great. I was allowed to priority board with my delta silver status. I even got access to skyteam lounge in Santiago without asking. Food was a bit of a let down especially since I requested a vegetarian meal. Other than that the entertainment was good not hundreds of choices but I found the selection of movies and programs fresh and entertaining. All four legs of the flight were on time and staff were very helpful. Even though I didn't know any Spanish I was able to communicate which is often a problem. Overall be it luck or their usual code of conduct I had a great experience with AM and would recommend to any one. Economical and comfortable despite a 16 hour trip.,Aeromexico,,4,

Staff not terribly helpful. I was initially booked on Los Angeles to Mexico City via Hermosillo with only a 45 minutes connection in Hermosillo. Was told by the staff at check-in they were not sure if that is sufficient time for me to make the connection but they would not change my flights because that's the way the ticket had been issued. In the end they changed it because the Los Angeles to Hermosillo flight was overbooked. Guadalajara to Culiacan departure was late so along with a couple of passengers we missed the Culiacan to Los Angeles flight. All the announcements for the late departure from Guadalajara was only in Spanish though when asked one of the flight attendants would occasionally kept me updated. Passengers were given the option of flying via Mexico City arriving about 12 hours later or to continue on to Tijuana and making our own way to Los Angeles at our own expense. Check in was very slow on all flights. Seems that for most of the departures in Mexico there is a system for printing your boarding passes at the machines in the airport but even then the queue for bag drop itself is at least 1 hour long including in Mexico City. The domestic lounge in Mexico City was reasonable. Hot food station (soup) was manned by staff. Was not particularly impressed by how the waiting staff asked for tips twice (once before serving the soup and once after serving the soup at the counter) when all they are doing is their job.,Aeromexico,,2,

Exactly 5 minutes later she showed up again noticed that I was still eating and asked me if I was done. The reason became clear right after desert was served. On this 12 hour flight there is only service in the first 2.5 hours and in the 90 minutes before landing. 8 full hours there is no flight attendant no drinks no snacks. They expect you to sleep and not bother the flight crew. If you can't sleep it will be a long flight. Entertainment is very limited. Movies in the section new are at least a year old. You have about 10 to choose from. Watching out of the window is prohibited by AeroMexico. The windows will be darkened 15 minutes after take off until 5 minutes before touchdown. Service was better in economy class on this flight. Expect AeroMexico business class at the level of ""Premium economy class"" on any other skyteam airline.

We left and arrived on time. I had a 3-hour layover before taking a flight to Toluca (at a bargain fare) and asked Cancun check-in staff if I could change that leg of the trip to MEX.

This really is the last time I will fly with them - going to pay more for United flights that go through Houston. It was amazing to read some of the reviews below that mirrored my experience. I missed a $150 flight and had to pay $600 to rebook! No sympathy. I was there at the gate 2 hours early so it wasn't that I was late. I hadn't got my passport stamped by immigration because I didn't see the table and even though I was told I had time to go get it stamped and I ran they closed the gate and I missed the flight. All the employees I dealt with were very cold and even seemed to take pleasure that I had missed my flight and had to buy a new ticket. There are so many bad reviews here that I hope others will refrain from using this airline until they adopt a more user friendly attitude.,Aeromexico,,,

Redeeming my skymiles I booked ATL-MEX a new ticket as Aeromexico was not willing to rebook me. At the end of my business trip in MEX I tried to check in for my return flight but I learnt that they have an internal policy that if you are not on your first flight they cancel your booking for the second flight. To get home I had to buy another ticket. The SkyTeam should really choose their codeshare partners more wisely. Never again.,Aeromexico,,,

When I was turned away there as well and sent back my flight had been closed for 5 minutes and nobody could help to get me on or even rebook me to the next available flight. After being stuck at the terminal for over 5 hours hanging on the phone with travel agent and Aeromexico I had to leave home again.

It took over an hour to get through that line-up. Carried my bag as fast as I could up to the area where connecting flights were to drop bags off - and to another line-up. The rep working there told me it was too late to catch my flight to Merida. It hadn't left but doors were closed. She told me to go and get a new flight across the hall. When I arrived there the rep told me that I must buy a new ticket. I was shocked. No other airline has ever made me pay for a new connection when I have been held up in a Customs line-up. Even the supervisor on shift would not bend. I could not believe this airline would treat a customer so badly. I had run as fast as possible between customs and baggage check-in - only to be told by the unfriendly agent that ""1.5 hours is enough time"" to catch my flight. So I paid for a new ticket - no choice! What stung even more was the feeling that AeroMexico just didn't care what happened to their customer arriving alone in a strange city.

When I got to the ticket counter the agent told me that the flight was fully booked and they were only accepting passengers with one piece of luggage. They were not accepting a second bag even if you wanted to pay. I asked them what I could do and they said I could board the flight but only if I left one bag behind. Forcing passengers with more than one luggage to give up their seats on an overbooked flight so they could solve their over booked flight without any compensation. If you ever take Aeromexico don't assume you can just pay for an extra bag. You can take 2 bags but you may have to either leave one behind or get moved to another flight. I let them move me to a flight the next day. I had to take all my luggage back home lugging it up the stairs because the escalators weren't working. No More Aeromexico for me.,Aeromexico,,3,

3351,,Business Class,,,yes,4,3,,,4,6,Aeromexico customer review,Marsha Rosner (United States) 6th May 2013,unk,Flight late departing Nashville to Cancun but made good time and arrived near original time. Plane clean cabin personnel courteous almost robot-like neatly dressed. Apparently the flight time from Nashville to Cancun is not a 'meal or snack' flight. We were offered complimentary sodas juice beer mixed drinks and a small cup of mixed nuts - one time - for our 2 hour 40 minute flight at 11am. We never saw the cabin attendants again until we landed. Should have used the call button for another drink! If price is good I would fly them again but I would definitely be more prepared with a meal purchased at the airport. The return flight was the same - invisible attendants except for initial drink. The gate attendant said we would receive a snack as the flight left at 6:30pm - guess what no snack just more nuts! Cannot rate food or entertainment. Entertainment was radio only with ear plug set passed out and collected before landing.,Aeromexico,,,

In general good price and good product for economy. Check in process in Mexico City fast and easy. Security control always very fast also no lines. Boarding process organized. On board always free snack. Departed and arrival on time most of the time only one time 10 min late. FA always nice. Bags fast on belt. Recommended.,Aeromexico,,4,

Most flights were on time and crew were friendly. For both long haul flights (EZE-MEX-EZE) the aircraft was a 767 without IFE. Food was quite good crew kept constantly giving out glasses of water tea or coffee even in MEX-EZE a 500ml bottle of water was on every economy class seat. If I get the chance I will fly them again.,Aeromexico,,2,
3354,,Business Class,,,no,3,2,2,,2,4,Aeromexico customer review,David Mejia (Mexico) 12th March 2013,unk,MEX-CDG-MEX. Food - awful both legs economy style (Chicken and pasta) and also overcooked. Only breakfast to CDG not so bad. Catering sequence nothing to do with Other Sky team airlines. Flight attendants do only what is necessary extras are difficult to get. Not recommended.,Aeromexico,,3,
3355,,Business Class,,,no,3,1,3,,2,3,Aeromexico customer review,Philip O'Connor (United Kingdom) 27th February 2013,unk,Travelled Premier Classe from Mexico City to Paris. This is an extremely poor business class product. On entering the plane we were offered a choice of water or orange juice; on asking for a glass of champagne was told very curtly by the steward that they had not chilled any so could not offer it! No personal IFE in seat only offer of ipad type product with limited selection. Meal very mediocre - choice of wines ok. Service from cabin crew very unfriendly and desultory - they seemed to have little interest in providing much service. Seat was acceptable. But this old 767 really needs an upgrade and the cabin crew need some serious customer service training. This business class product in no way compares with Air France or KLM their Skyteam and codeshare partners.,Aeromexico,,1,

Flight half full we sat all ready to go in the cabin without air for a good 15 minutes before we were on our way. The aircraft had slim seats which tend to be the new trend with airlines to reduce weight and give a little more leg room. Leg room was OK but comfort of the seat is poor due to the lack of padding giving you some back pain even for a flight of a little over an hour. Drink service was OK staff friendly and attentive. Arrival on time.,Aeromexico,,,
3358,,Business Class,,,no,1,1,1,,1,unk,Aeromexico customer review,R Carvalho (Mexico) 20th February 2013,unk,Mexico to Madrid and onward to Geneva via Air Europa. At check in they bungled up my frequent flyer number and kept telling me it was invalid. After the lousy check-in process I proceeded to the lounge at Mexico City airport terminal 2. The lounge has slow service with a poor selection of snacks and drinks. Lounge was crowded too. Inflight the seats in business were very small on this 767. The seats don't lie flat but at an angle. The best part no in-flight entertainment. The staff handed out ipads with a very limited selection of movies and TV shows. Food was awful and they did not have my option. Flight attendants could not be bothered with requests and soon disappeared after serving us our meals. Despite attempts to call them no one showed up. This is not business class but at best premium economy. Overall a very poor experience.,Aeromexico,,1,

Flight was on time staff friendly bags delivered by the time I had deplaned.,Aeromexico,,,
3360,,Business Class,,,no,2,3,2,,,unk,Aeromexico customer review,S Moseley (Australia) 13th February 2013,unk,Will never fly with them again. We missed our Aero Mexico flight to LA through their incompetence and consequently our onward connection to Australia that evening. Ground staff were next to useless and we got the run-around for 4 hours being passed from one supervisor to another with no-one wanting to take responsibility with lots of shrugging of shoulders. We had to organise our new flights ourselves at some cost to us. Once on board the premier class is just like premium economy although its supposed to be the equivalent of business class. Food and service is basic. I believe they have plans to fly from MEX to LHR shortly. They will have to lift their game to be any competition to existing carriers on that route. We love Mexico but will use another airline in the future.,Aeromexico,,1,
3361,,Economy Class,,,no,2,1,1,,1,1,Aeromexico customer review,R Carvalho (Mexico) 28th January 2013,unk,Flew Mexico City to New York and back in December 2012. At the time of booking was told that a baby bassinet and baby food would be provided for my infant. When I called to reconfirm the flight 2 days before travel I was told that Aeromexico did not have bassinets on a 5 hour flight from Mex to NY. Felt tricked as I was not given this information at the time of booking. In-flight entertainment non existent no personal video screens and unclean airplane on the way into JFK. Movie was shown on an overhead screen unfortunately the headphones provided were non functional. The food was horrible and neither me nor my wife ate the food no baby food provided for my infant. The only positive from the flight was that the plane was empty and we could place our baby on the seat between us. It would have been very hard to carry the baby on our lap for 5 hours without a bassinet. On the return flight check-in was a mess at JFK the staff were not efficient and when we asked if the flight was on time we were told it was. We rushed through security and when we reached the gate the flight was delayed 2.5 hours. The airline staff were not competent and no one could explain the reason for the delay. Inflight food was terrible no video screens despite the plane being brand new. No baby food for the infant. Again the only positive for the return flight was that the baby had a seat between us as the flight was empty. Overall a bad experience for us and our infant.,Aeromexico,,1,

Boarded a brand new 737-800 with IFE in Biz and coach classes. In MEX went to the AM lounge - its excellent. Boarded (777-200ER) sat in Premier Class all the way to PVG. It has a tech stop over TIJ which turned out not so bad you don't even get off the plane at TIJ just crew changes and on we went to Shanghai. It was a 14.45 min flight but sleeping eating movies and great crews made my flight amazing!,Aeromexico,,4,
3363,,Economy Class,,,no,3,1,3,,1,1,Aeromexico customer review,Sandra Perez (United Kingdom) 8th November 2012,unk,"Flew from Madrid to Mexico City. First off my flight was delayed for reasons that none of the staff at the desk was able to explain. Check in was extremely disorganised and poorly signaled. About 1 hour into 14 hour flight I noticed that my inflight entertainment screen was still off while other passengers' screens were on. Then it turned out that 6 rows did not have working inflight entertainment screens or overhead reading lights. As soon as we let the staff know they told us they would ""reset the system"" and let people at the front of the plane know. About 30 minutes later nothing was working and we asked again what the status was. We were told quite rudely that they were looking into it. Needless to say this carried on for another 3 hours. It became evident that the flight attendants were avoiding our section as we could see them walking around offering water to passengers in the aisle on the other side of the plane quite often. Finally about 4.5 hours into the flight the person sitting next to me asked once more whether they'd managed to see what was wrong with our screens. The flight attendant said ""well obviously it's not working. Didn't you figure that out?"". I can understand that technical problems may arise but that does not mean that paying customers should be treated rudely. I was very happy to finally land in Mexico city after 14 hours of a tortuous flight. I am very hesitant to fly with Aeromexico again if this is the standard of customer service that they have.",Aeromexico,,1,

I was very hesitant but chose to do so as I was taking 5 people with me and it was $250.00 cheaper pp to fly Aeromexico than the other domestic airlines. My experience turned out to be a very pleasant one. Other than legroom being a little tight in economy on 2 of the 4 flights planes were clean on time staff very pleasant and flight attendants dressed well. Mexico City airport was very easy to manage. My experience was just as good if not better than any other domestic airline.,Aeromexico,,3,
3365,,Economy Class,,,yes,3,5,5,,5,9,Aeromexico customer review,J Giraldo (United States) 9th October 2012,unk,Flew AeroMexico for the first time in economy class from JFK to Cancun return. Aside from the legroom or lack of I can't make any negative comments. We were given a pretty good breakfast half hour into the flight nice hot coffee and flight attendents made multiple beverage runs throughout the 3.5hr flt. The return was pretty much the same except it was a dinner flight and they offered complimentary alcohol. I'd say AeroMexico is a much better airline to travel to Mexico in economy class then US carriers.,Aeromexico,,4,

Why bother asking me online what seat I want when I cant even get it when I book months in advance? Once onboard it was quite stuffy and hot. Surprisingly they did serve a meal. The return was ok but the cabin crew were pretty rude and unfriendly. I wouldn't recommend Aeromexico unless you looking for a cheap flight and have no expectation.,Aeromexico,,,

Full flight and despite this the airline manages to board everyone very quickly. The crew of Aeromexico have a very high Uniform standard and are very professional. On this 2.5 hour flight I was offered a complete breakfast drinks including alcoholic drinks newspapers and headphones. Their Hub in Mexico City is definitely the best terminal in North America.,Aeromexico,,,

Aeromexico is the only airline to have a direct flight from Montreal to Mexico City. 5 hours flight very disappointed being the first time flying with them. The aircraft a 737-800 looked very tired and dirty no personal ICE what am I doing here staff food so so at least the cabin was almost empty so I was able to stretch my legs through the flight to not get bored at all. As usual some people are luckier than others in my case it turned not a nice experience. At least we arrived almost on time.,Aeromexico,,,

On a return flight from Madrid to Mexico city. After asking three staff member there was nothing to do according to them. On board we had asked for special food and again no sign of it. On the way back we called in advance to have a front row seat and staff at the telephone were helpful but while checking in at the airport we found ourselves in a back seat. Again the special meal was nowhere to be seen. In the future I will try to avoid using this company.,Aeromexico,,,

From Mexico City to Oaxaca we got on board on time then had to wait almost an hour and a half for 3 more passengers. 3 people making 100+ people wait. Flight back from OAX-MEX-SAT Oaxaca to Mexico was fine. From Mexico City to San Antonio we arrive at our gate at 7.13 flight was scheduled to leave at 7.10. Aeromexico representative made no effort to try and communicate our situation to the flight crew made no effort to try and help us reschedule a flight simply turned away. Had to go talk to another rep who let us know that since we booked our flight online she couldn't sell us another ticket until I got in touch with the online site and figured out their procedure. I have no phone in Mexico and no Internet which made this extremely difficult. Never flying Aeromexico again.,Aeromexico,,,
3371,,Economy Class,,,no,,,,,1,2,Aeromexico customer review,J Larsen (United States) 7th August 2012,unk,Airport staff refused to relay flight information in English to all English speaking customers. Mexico City airport is poorly labelled and difficult to find your way around. When we asked staff for help or directions we were given different directions each time. Since we has a 12 delay due to yet another flight cancellation we tested this hypothesis on a 7 staff members. When we originally selected our flights to Costa Rica this airline offered the best route. Flight times were great no more than 2 hour layovers and we were to reach our destination in less than 9 hours. By the time this airline finished canceling and delaying all our flights it took us over 30 hours to reach our destination. Total fight time was only 6.5 hours. Plus we were given immigration documentation in Spanish only and told it didn't come in English.,Aeromexico,,,
3372,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,7,Aeromexico customer review,N Junzo (Brazil) 1st August 2012,unk,GRU-MEX-LAX roundtrip. GRU-MEX on B777-200 comfortable aircraft good legroom individual but limited IFE. Offered complimentary alcoholic beverages but meals were inedible. MEX-LAX on B737-700 fair legroom. Aeromexico has an odd confusing boarding procedure - instead of using boarding groups based on seat rows just like most of airlines they call passengers by seat type: window middle or aisle. That means if you are travelling with relatives or acquaintances boarding will have to be individual. If you consider connecting through Mexico City be aware that no matter the destination is you will have to go through immigration and customs. So think twice if your final destination is the US.,Aeromexico,,,
3373,,Economy Class,,,no,,,,,1,3,Aeromexico customer review,Joann Baeza (United States) 16th July 2012,unk,Our flight was from Cancun to Mexico City then to LAX. The airport terminal was extremely warm and the flight left late. Not sure what the problem was but it was very hot on both flights. Since our flight left Cancun late we had to run from one gate to the other in order to not miss our connecting flight. So of course since we barely made our flight our bags didn't we were told our luggage would be delivered the next morning - well it is almost 8 pm and still no luggage. Not sure I would ever fly Aeromexico again.,Aeromexico,,,

After the flight was delayed for 2 hrs in TIJ with no explanation the ground crew had the audacity to ask me why we were late to catch the CUN flight. Seats were very uncomfortable for Biz class no leg room and the pitch hardly had any angle. My neck was hurting after couple of hrs. Food awful. FA's couldn't care less attitude made this 6 hrs trip unbearable.,Aeromexico,,,

Aeromexico ground staff in Guad made it possible for us to catch our connecting flight. We were met in P.V. on the tarmac and were personally escorted through the airport rushed through immigration phone calls were made to ensure that our luggage had been transferred and we made it onto the WestJet flight with only 5 minutes to spare. We had a hotel and rental car booked and paid for in Calgary so we had to get there and we did.,Aeromexico,,,

Flight to MEX was comfortable however the flight attendant couldn't be bothered to do anything with the meal and the omelette was served cold. Club Premier lounge in DF was great with food wine and showers. Flight to Sao Paulo was average food was great however I didn't think the seat was as comfortable as LAN. All in all decent - much better than an American airline to S America.,Aeromexico,,,

Shocked to learn a week before the trip that the flight was changed to have a layover in Mexico city. Now the flight turned into a 8 hour trip. Despite never advising of the change Aeromexico had the audacity to try to charge a $150 cancellation fee. On the connecting plane I spoke to other passengers who gave similar or even worse stories. Some said the website still showed a direct flight from their destinations even though it had changed.,Aeromexico,,,

Business/First poor boarding seat cramped meal was a bad ham sandwich. Plane was a 737-700 that was late departing. As we approached LAX there was fog and we were told we were going to Tijuana. On arrival at Tijuana passengers told we would be flown back to Mexico City. As a few passengers complained we were eventually let off the plane but told we were 'on our own'. Airline did not care less and said they had no responsibility for the situation. Bags took 30 minutes to show up. The product was bad to start with but the whole experience was just awful. Ended up taking a taxi to San Diego and then having to drive myself to LA.,Aeromexico,,,

Cabin looked spacious and clean. Seat was ok but sleeping was not easy as it was angled. Moreover the config was 2-3-2 so if sat in the middle and pax next to you are asleep you have to jump over them. AVOD system was reliable. The food was tasty as Aeromexico have started a new collaboration with a group of chefs. There was also an express dining option for those of us who wanted to sleep. The crew were attentive and helpful with high uniform standards. They responded effectively to customer needs and were constantly through the cabin offering drinks and top ups. Two hours before landing breakfast was served. Flight landed in MAD on time. Great flight and exceeded expectations.,Aeromexico,,,

Outbound the 12.40 am departure time became 4.30 am due to a crew issue. The plane was an older 737. The EmPower jacks at our seats were dead and there was grime on the hard part of the seat. There was no special meal service for business class - everybody got a small ham and cheese sandwich. The front toilet quickly got foul but that didn't stop a steady stream of coach passengers coming up front for it. The FA's were nowhere to be seen. AM has no connections/transfers desks for international arriving passengers at MEX. We instead had to go out to the airport lobby and stand in line for an hour at the ticket counter for a rebooking of our missed connection to OAX. Staff working in the ticketing lobby were rude. On the return flight to SFO it was the same older plane and yes the same type of ham sandwich for dinner. Only highlight of flying AM was that we ended up spending a lot of time at the Salon Premier lounges in T2 which were nice though filled to the gills.,Aeromexico,,,

At check-in I requested for check-thru for my baggage but the man in the counter said it is not possible. I got alarmed when my other colleagues (we were in a group reservation) baggage were checked-thru. I had to recall from baggage and made to baggage drop for check-thru to Manila via Narita. Mexico City to Tijuana leg we were assigned a seat number - 14E which did not exist. So they found us seats on row 22. When we reached Tijuana we stayed on board and we asked if we needed to change seats as we were given boarding pass with different seat assignments. Again I was assigned seat 12A which still does not exist in the plane. We were made to sit in other seats and we had to bring our blankets and earphones because they do not issue fresh ones. We had connecting flights in Narita for our trip to Manila. When we got to Manila our baggage did not come with us. For 2 days we tracked our delayed baggage and learned they were not loaded apparently when we left Mexico.,Aeromexico,,,

Check in took 1.5 hours we got 5 seats two or 3 rows separated from each other (3 kids 47 and 10). We relied on the kindness of people on the plane to get all the seats together. For delays we lost the connection flight to SLP in Mexico City and we got a flight next day (18 hours later from our original). I asked for compensation for the hotel expenses We got nothing but the worst is that at the next day We just find out that local passengers got hotel expenses and we were international. I am going to use this airline.,Aeromexico,,,

Two days after the switchover to the SABRE reservation system check-in was still delayed a lot because they never trained their staff on the new system! My SAT-MEX flight left and arrived two hours late. There was no announcement of the cause for the delay. It took the agents about 10 minutes to check a passenger. As passengers finally trickled to the gate there was no agent and no sign confirming that this was an Aeromexico departure gate - and there was no plane. On the return May 29 things were still a bit slow that's when the agent told me that she had arrived at work on May 22 to find totally new screens on which she had received no training. The system also told them (on May 29) that I hadn't paid when in fact it was a prepaid Expedia ticket. Apparently they had changed the flight number right as they were switching systems and my reservation was not transferred correctly. After my flight boarded they announced that the co-pilot hadn't arrived! Hence a half-hour delay. Totally amateurish performance throughout by this airline which I will try to avoid flying.,Aeromexico,,,

T2 Terminal in MEX is comfortable and acceptable eating and other amenities. MEX-JFK a hot meal and beverages incl alcohol and newspapers/magazines. FAs were curt.

The next day our flight was delayed due to a flight attendant not having correct documentation to leave the country.

Staff were charming and helpful. We had a delay leaving Acapulco and the agent who checked us in for the flight came and told us that the flight was delayed leaving Mexico City. He had rebooked our flight to LAX and changed our baggage claim tags. We both had first class seats assigned. Unfortunately we both found the new first class seat design on the 737-800 torturous. The headrest appears to have been designed for crash test dummies. We had been much more comfortable in our coach seats.,Aeromexico,,,

3407,,Economy Class,,,no,,,,,1,unk,Aeromexico customer review,S Anthony (United States) 26th June 2010,unk,LAX to PVR. It's unethical to say the least. AeroMexico had a good selection of non-stop flights from LAX to PVR. Seats were more expensive than connecting flights on the U.S. based airlines. We were willing to pay extra for the non-stop flight. A week before our departure AeroMexico moved us to an indirect flight connecting through Mexico City. Our only other option was accepting a voucher from AeroMexico and rebooking on another airline at our own expense. Due to the short notice all flights (even connecting) were two to three times more expensive than they were when we had originally purchased the tickets. The annoyance doesn't end there. In Mexico City we only had one hour to change planes. Normally this would be easy. We didn't know we had to go through customs. There were hundreds of people already in line. Needless to say we missed our connection. We waited all day in the airport for another flight that had seats available.,Aeromexico,,,

Nice and fast check-in procedures inside the beautiful Aeromexico lounge at new Terminal 2. Flight operated by a freshly re-painted B737-800 - first time I experience an almost 6 hour flight on this kind of plane but the interior was clean and confortable so this was not a big issue. The only problem was that we were at row 12 just before the emergency exit so our seats would not recline for safety reasons: I would have appreciated to be informed about that before the assignment! Meal was served very early (6pm) considering mexican habits but I did not eat so I cannot judge. Crew polite even if not very friendly. We arrived at Lima half an hour ahead of schedule. Overall a positive experience but the price could have been more competitive (we paid EUR 1.000 for two economy tickets).,Aeromexico,,,

We had 2 checked bags going from Mexico City to Seattle they lost one of them. We reported it missing and then called the next day and they said they had no report and couldn't find the package. They gave us numbers to phones where no one would answer and were completely apathetic. Once they finally found the luggage they then shipped it 5 hours away from our home instead of to the Portland airport which is 15 minutes away. Then they lost the baggage in Yakima! Turns out they shipped it to Canada - still working on getting it back.,Aeromexico,,,

One toilet closed for whole trip the other two were not clean and almost out of tissue. Food was enough and fine for me. Many drink options. Flying time was less than 10 hours on my way to Tehran and less than 8 on the way back to Shanghai.

This flight was then delayed by over an hour and there was no information given as to how long the delay would be - the aircraft just didn't turn up. Once finally on board no acknowledgement of the delay but otherwise ok - a small sandwich and drink were served which was fine for such a short flight.

In addition to this as the plane that took us up was very small for the flight he was forced to make an additional stop to fuel in Cali Colombia. The planes we had to take us to get to Miami were dirty with broken seats no kind of entertainment (such as TV). The poor and inattentive staff of course had to deal with few resources. The return flight similar. Delays old planes but most of the journey by plane Miami-Santa Cruz had a noise in your engine that was intolerable to the ears. Large number of passengers frightened by the strange sound was heard constantly.,Aerosur,,,
3416,,,,,no,,,,,,6,Aerosur customer review,K Beard 23rd August 2009,unk,Santa Cruz to Cochabamba Cochabamba to La Paz. This airline tries hard to fill the gap left by the collapse of Aero Lloyd Boliviano but is still plagued by constant changes to schedules usually because the aircraft flying the international route (Brazil) is late in arriving in Santa Cruz and therefore delays the local flights. It also tends to overbook flights and then moves confirmed ticket holders to later flights (it is really important to reconfirm flights) and will even change flight schedules back in time so flights depart 2 hours earlier then scheduled. The airline is fine if you are not in a hurry and don't mind delayed flights changed schedules and don't mind having confirmed tickets ignored.,Aerosur,,,

Checking in took about forever and the Aerosur ground staff forgot to mention airport tax that still had to be paid. This was mentioned by security officers with only 15 minutes to go. We still made it on time despite the lack of help of ground staff. TJA-VVI. While checking in I was offered to take a flight right way or two hours later. I choose the latter but was refused because the luggage guy had already tagged my suitcase for the early flight. Of course they couldn't get it back. Again total lack of service of ground staff. The flights were ok albeit not on time. Flying in these countries is never on time. Despite all this I would certainly choose AeroSur next time but only because there's no reasonable alternative.,Aerosur,,,

My premium economy flight from Kumasi to Accra was delayed by 2 hours after checking in but nobody from the airline told us any reason. All the passengers were crowded into a small area with no social distancing as if there was no pandemic happening. When we finally boarded the flight, the hostess was constantly removing her nose mask to flirt with some politician in the front seat. I asked her for a cup of coffee and was refused because she said only water is allowed due to COVID. For the extra price that we are paying for premium economy and the number of hours that they hold us hostage we deserve better! The seat was dirty and the armrest plastic was chipped, while the signs on the ancient noisy plane were all in Chinese. You could feel the plane shaking the whole time during the flight which makes you wonder if they even do proper maintenance. We finally reached our destination nearly 3 hours late but my baggage did not arrive. There were people from earlier flights also waiting there for their bags so this seems to be a very common thing. The airport staff were rude and told us to wait and maybe our bags would come, maybe not. I wound up missing my flight on Turkish Airlines while waiting for the bag and had to pay for a hotel and to get a new PCR test to travel the next day.

Then when we arrived in Ghana, they charged me another £120 to take another test at the airport there. Why can't they just charge one single price for their services instead of advertising one price and then trying to squeeze more money out of their poor customers?

Terrible service. 4 hours before our scheduled flight and cancelled our flight. There was no notice from the airline, we received the email after we were told that it was cancelled. The customer service response was not professional. When asked for why it was cancelled, we were notified that it was a technical problem which is surprising that 4-hours before the flight, only then did they think about confirming a cancelled flight. Normally, airlines would provide compensation to make sure the customer is not inconvenienced. Their first question was, ""do you have a place to stay here in Ghana?"" This of course should not be the first question to ask a customer who is not from the country. Had it not been for the collective anger and frustration of all passengers on the original flight, there would not have been any quick movement to get us on another flight. Even though it is a small airline or growing airline, the experience was more frustrating for us as a customer. Lastly, the manager or person in charge of transferring us to another flight did not care enough to get our contact information to notify us that we had successfully been transferred to another flight. Instead, when we happened to pass by again he looked at us surprised saying ""Why are you here? You should be checking in right now at the other airline!"". When we were never told of such thing at all. Overall, a frustrating experience and not looking to book with Africa World Airlines ever again.

The start seemed off putting when I noticed an extra three hours on the flight time from Tripoli to Joburg which the booking office could not explain also when I was not on the reservations list at check-in. However the latter was sorted without hassle. Service on flight to Tripoli was fine plane new and clean food good. However we landed in a sandstorm which was worrying. Fortunately we were herded along to the departures lounge as all signs in Arabic. Onward flight delayed by a couple of hours due to sandstorm. Toilets at the airport were inadequate in number but reasonably clean. We were then taken on what felt like a mystery tour on an airport bus down a dirt road - turned out to be to the other end of the runway where our plane sat all on its own amidst military aircraft. The three hour extra time was now clear as it was a much smaller plane than expected (a few passengers had seats allocated on row numbers which were not on the smaller plane - however there was enough room and extra for everyone boarding). Once again food and service fine. There was a refuelling stop at Kinshasa. During my week in S Africa the revolution in Libya took off. I expected to lose my money and have to rebook myself back on an alternative carrier. However when I contacted Afriqiyah in Joburg they said I was re-booked on Egyptair travelling back same night as my original booking. They sent me email confirmation and my trip home went smoothly. The Afriqiyah staff were helpful and efficient in spite of what was obviously a stressful time for them.

It was almost funny how clueless they were! Staff were friendly but no idea of customer service or professionalism. The quality of the food seems to be dependant of the airport you last left leaving SA or the UK the food was ok with a North African theme but when we left Tripoli the food was inedible. The flights are dry so they only serve warm juice or soda. The movies are heavily censored at first it's quite amusing but it gets irritating after a while. Woman's shoulders are blurred out and they even censor out all references to alcohol or gambling but blood death & murder are all good! Tripoli Airport is awful you can barely breath for the smoke and there's no organisation it's like going back it time.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3437,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,Karen Parker (United Kingdom) 26th May 2010,unk,London Gatwick - Tripoli - Accra return. Tripoli to Accra was delayed a little as only one scanner was working so when they started boarding about half the passengers were still on the wrong side of the security check. The other flights were on time. Food good seats comfy checked luggage was where it should be price was excellent. Having read previous comments here I had to see how bad the loos at Tripoli airport could be and was disappointed : clean and even soap in the dispenser!,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3438,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,M Bekkering (United Kingdom) 19th March 2010,unk,London -Johannesburg via Tripoli return. I took the precaution of travelling hand luggage only and making sure not to use the bathrooms during the stop over at Tripoli and was pleasantly surprised. The service matched any I've travelled with over the years and at half the price. Considering they offer the option of twice as much luggage in the hold as any other airline I've travelled with I might even travel with lots of luggage next time!,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3439,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,C Grant (France) 15th February 2010,unk,CDG-TIP-OUA out ABJ-TIP-CDG return. Excellent flight to TIP clean new A330 with good food and friendly staff. Flight to OUA similarly well presented. Unfortunately the flight from ABJ-TIP was operated by Nouvelair on Afriqiyah's behalf other passengers also noticed the difference with grumpy staff and terrible food. Happy to return to CDG with Afriqiyah again and more good service.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3440,,Economy Class,,,no,,,,,1,unk,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,B Humphrey (United Kingdom) 23rd January 2010,unk,Crew dreadful food cold - delays from start to finish on outbound and inbound. Tripoli is the filthiest most hostile place and staff bully passengers especially female. We were delayed for 8hrs and no one would help. They all smoke in the no smoking areas the toilets have to be seen to be believed. Brand new planes are good but there the value stops - it is just not worth the saving on flight costs.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3441,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,H Brant (United Kingdom) 23rd January 2010,unk,"London Gatwick-Tripoli-Johannesburg return. I booked on price so my expectations were fairly low. The first three sectors were more or less on time fourth just under 30 minutes late. I was pleasantly surprised to find LGW check-in desk open nearly 4 hours before the scheduled departure time! Airline food is rarely very good in economy but Afriqiyah's compared quite favourably with most. My only criticism is that a couple of dishes were quite spicy - and a choice was not always offered. I was pleasantly surprised by the in-flight entertainment which had a modern touch-screen interface and seemed to be reliable. Legroom was good. For me the only negative issue really was Tripoli Airport. The departure lounge is small and not very comfortable. There were people smoking despite ""no smoking"" signs. Maybe smoking is only allowed in certain areas but the smoke carries everywhere. The toilets are in serious need of modernisation too. I was glad I didn't have to spend long there. The staff there were pleasant and helpful though. I would consider flying with Afriqiyah again if the price is right especially once the expansion and upgrading of Tripoli Airport is complete.",Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3442,,Economy Class,,,no,,,,,1,2,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,A Regan (United Kingdom) 20th January 2010,unk,"In June 2009 I booked a trip from London to Cape Town (via Tripoli) with Afriqiyah Airways leaving on Christmas day for about £400 - a pretty good deal. However in September they decided to stop in Johannesburg instead and booked us a transfer from Johannesburg to Capetown. Alas on our way out after an unscheduled stop in Paris to pick up ""a few passengers"" and a 4-5 hour unexplained delay in Tripoli we missed the connecting flight and had to pay £200 each for new tickets - despite reassurances from Afriqiyah Airways in Tripoli that they had transferred us onto later flights. In the end we were travelling for over 24 hours. On the way back the travel documents we used to travel out were not accepted in Johannesburg airport and we had to call the UK from a mobile to get further details. Once again we got stuck in Tripoli airport for over ten hours due to snow at Gatwick. Tripoli airport is awful - it is one giant ashtray with disgusting toilets. Despite the lovely planes this was the worst airline experience I have had.",Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3443,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,Stephanie McVicker (United Kingdom) 14th January 2010,unk,I flew to Johannesburg via Brussels and Tripoli return. Flight attendants great who provided a cheerful and competent service. One even went to the business class to get me a lovely cup of coffee when he realised coffee was crucial to my travelling pleasure! Yes there were delays in Tripoli - but immigration officials were welcoming and we were kept fully informed as to the reasons for hold up. Toilets in Tripoli are as bad as everyone else suggests - do avoid. Useful to know that they accept Euros in their Duty Free and cafe.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3444,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,9,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,Michael Redman (United Kingdom) 18th October 2009,unk,I have used Afriqiyah Airways for four return trips Gatwick - Accra over the last 14 months. Treatment has been unfailingly good. Yes there have been delays but informed of the reasons for the delays and on one occasion we were given drinks while we waited to go into the airport. The cabin crew are excellent and value for money is good.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3445,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,5,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,Jordan Mandoza (United Kingdom) 7th October 2009,unk,London-Tripoli-Johannesburg. Tripoli airport toilets are so bad you really have to be desperate to use them. Airline good value for money. Cabin crew not very cheerful looked tired all times. The only reason I would fly with them again is value for money but more friendly and cheerful cabin crew needed. A330 plane has good leg room and clean but the A320 plane not much leg room and needs cleaning up.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3446,,Economy Class,,,yes,,,,,4,8,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,B Quigley (United Kingdom) 23rd August 2009,unk,Tripoli - London Gatwick - Tripoli. New plan good entertainment attentive service. No problems apart from painfully slow Check-In at Gatwick and no alcohol.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3447,,,,,no,,,,,,4,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,L Olonode 16th July 2009,unk,Dakar-Tripoli-Gatwick. Fantastic seats and legroom. Food was good as was in-flight entertainment. Friendly efficient cabin staff. Late departure but arrived on time. Price lower than alternative carriers.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3448,,,,,no,,,,,,3,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,B Ajinibi 4th May 2009,unk,Lagos to Tripoli was ok except the deplorable condition of the toilet no inflight entertainment cabin crews were boring beyond description meal was ok. Landed at Tripoli airport on time and cheerful ground crew. I have never seen a worse and appalling toilets like what I saw at the Tripoli airport. Tripoli to Gatwick flight was ok a better and newer aircraft more responsive cabin crew inflight entertainment though without headset arrived Gatwick on time. Return flight was almost a replication of the inbound flights except that there was headset for inflight entertainment. Afriqiyah should replace aircraft flying Lagos leg its below international standard and they dare not fly such aircraft to Gatwick. Will fly them if they improve on the hygiene,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3449,,,,,no,,,,,,3,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,Peter Higgins 27th April 2009,unk,Dubai - Tripoli - Dakar. All in all the flight experience was a pleasure with very good food good seat space and regular drinks - the spare seat next to me also helped. It was also good not to have the flight constantly interrupted by announcements of one kind or another in three different languages as seems to be the trend these days. Tripoli airport isn't a pleasure but no worse than you would expect and every landing seemed calmer than I am used to on the bigger planes. Two big faults though: firstly we had to turn the plane around for a sick passenger and no one made any announcement until about 5 seconds before landing which made most of us think we had turned around for a plane fault. Secondly on the outward flight my bags arrived two days late. Not a disaster for me but certainly it could have been for some people. No apology no attempt to trace me when the bag arrived (though they said they were just about to). Also only 3 movies for 26 hours of flying. Very cheap and comfortable.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3450,,,,,no,,,,,,4,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,Rob Sidley 2nd February 2009,unk,London - Tripoli - Accra. Have to say that in both directions a pleasant and trouble free flight. Onboard catering was fine and Coach class seating exceeded standard specs both pitch and quality of seats. New aircraft but remember that this is a dry airline so no alcohol available. Overall I would be happy to fly with them again.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3451,,,,,no,,,,,,3,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,Dan Harvey 6th January 2009,unk,The airline has improved since I first started travelling with them4 years ago. The airplanes are new food is great seats comfortable and staff are improving. However the baggage service is a big disgrace. At the airport in Mali the service is useless and at the office in Bamako they cannot tell us anything. So until Afriqiyah can improve this I will not be travelling Afriqiyah again.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3452,,,,,no,,,,,,3,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,A King 22nd December 2008,unk,Gatwick to Accra. I was not disappointed with the quality of service - time seat cleanliness entertainment and food. Each section of the trip proceeded smoothly and I felt comfortable. Whilst the airline was superb I was disappointed with the toilet facilities at Tripoli. On both the outbound and the inbound flights I have never seen an international airport with deplorable and unhygienic toilets like the ones I saw in Tripoli.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3453,,,,,no,,,,,,3,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,F Mahmood 11th November 2008,unk,Ouagadougou to Gatwick - the plane which was due to leave Ouaga at 1.00 am arrived at 4am & departed at 5am. I asked one of the ground staff before departure if I could possible catch the connecting flight at Tripoli which was due to leave at 8.30 am considering that it was a 4 hours flight to Tripoli and 2 hours time difference in advance. I was reassured more than once that I will catch the plane and even a message had been sent to wait for me there. I boarded the plane with a lot of apprehension and when we arrived at Tripoli I was not surprised to find that the plane had left without me 2 hrs earlier. I contacted Afriqiyah staff and they looked embarased and didn't know what to do with me - I had to stay in the airport lounge till the next day when one of the staff took somehow pity on me & upgraded my ticket to the first class. Food is not bad inflight service good and 48 kg baggage allowance for somehow modest ticket price.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3454,,,,,no,,,,,,2,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,S Anutika 7th November 2008,unk,I travelled London Gatwick-Tripoli-Douala with Afriqiyah recently. Arriving 4 hours late at 01.00 hours I discovered that my luggage and that of most of the other passengers was not on the plane. I could get no information from staff at the airport but was told that I would have to wait until Monday for the next scheduled flight to see if it was forwarded. With my schedule completely ruined and no change of clothing I had to book a hotel at my own expense and wait till Monday. I spent most of Monday at the airport trying to get information without success. Finally at 22.30 I was reunited with my luggage. Some passengers on that flight also did not get their luggage. I will not be using this airline in future even if it is still the cheapest deal.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3455,,,,,no,,,,,,3,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,Michael Redman 18th September 2008,unk,Gatwick-Accra-Gatwick and found the journey up to expectations. On time both directions and the onboard staff very attentive without being fussy. The let-down was Tripoli airport on arrival from Gatwick: very scruffy and down-at-heel and staff bullying passengers into line for us to obtain Boarding Cards for the Tripoli-Accra leg of the journey. Information was less than brilliant too. The return transfer was a better but that's probably because I knew what to expect! Afriqiyah Airways are good value in my opinion.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3456,,,,,no,,,,,,4,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,T Cisse 26th August 2008,unk,London-Tripoli-Dakar returning in June. Much better than charter flights from Paris or charters to Gambia. Very few people on all legs of the flight meant that everyone could stretch out over 3 seats fast and efficient check-in I was told I could have taken 40kg but the ticket issued through last minute.com only said 23kg. Entertainment good western and arabic films interesting documentary and tapes of Koran. Staff responsive but dont fuss laid back will give extra food plenty of drinks. Food all Halal and more'real than that served on 'western flights' but the same on return. Delay at Gatwick but they held all connecting flights in Tripoli. Planes modern and clean. Staff helpful and responsive in Dakar in changing return flight for under £50. Good cheap way to get to West Africa. This is an airline that caters for ordinary people and adequately meets those needs.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3457,,,,,no,,,,,,2,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,J Essomba 17th June 2008,unk,Afriqiyah Airways customer service is non-existent. I travelled from London via Tripoli to Cameroon last December. I lost my luggage - I am still to be compensated and nobody seem to care. I will think twice before travelling again with this airline.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
3458,,,,,no,,,,,,1,Afriqiyah Airways customer review,Nick Imboden 30th May 2008,unk,Have just flown to and from Tripoli. They were late leaving Gatwick on the outward journey due to missing passengers and luggage having to be removed but check-in etc was fine although we only had hand luggage. We returned on a new A320 Airbus. We left Tripoli on time and touched down at Gatwick on the dot. The service was fine and the food was acceptable.,Afriqiyah Airways,,,
